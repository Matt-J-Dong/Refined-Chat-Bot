# Refined-Chat-Bot

> Can large language models respond to questions in character, including questions that the character would not know?

## Motivation
Our project goal is to create a chat bot based on either a fictional or real individual that would be able to respond true to character. Many models are pretrained on large corpuses that fall outside of the information scope of the actual character or individual and we hope to remedy that problem.\\
In recent years, with the release of ChatGPT, large language models have been used in all different types of fields and businesses. One such use of large language models has been to replicate the personality and knowledge of certain fictional characters. People have trained numerous models with the dialogue and actions of fictional characters in order to create a chat bot that can respond as their favorite character. However, many of the publicly available chatbots share the same problem: access to knowledge outside of their fictional counterpart's knowledge. As such, our objective is to refine the scope of the chat bot's knowledge and ensure that they answer questions true to character rather than defaulting to the information trained on the base model. In doing so, we hope to be able to train chat bot's on real life individuals to try to predict how a person may respond to a question or situation through training the chat bot on a person's own writing, quotes, and related works. A refined chat bot would be particularly useful to prepare for rebuttals in a debate and prepare for any questions that could potentially be asked. Creating a chat bot based solely on a single individual will also reveal some interesting questions on just how accurate a chatbot could be in replicating a person's speech and just how much of an impact a person's prior beliefs have on their present character.

## Methodology
QuizVerse is designed with both students (like us) and teachers in mind, to help create a platform for learning through spaced repetition. For students approaching a new subject and preparing for an upcoming exam, to teachers who want to create an aggregated flashcard set to provide to their class, QuizVerse is created with all those use cases in mind. QuizVerse will work to maximize retention and activity for students through gamification, drawing from experience working with different platforms that offer services to self-study.

## How?

First, create a username and password to create an account to save your flashcards under.

To add new flashcards, just enter them as text or as images. You can also categorize the flashcards by the due date and subject.

In your daily study session, QuizVerse will provide you with one side of the flashcard, and you'll have to recall what's on the other side. By completing your daily study session, you will receive points and extend your study streak. Your study streak will be displayed whenever you enter the app.

You can also study on demand whenever you want to get points. You can narrow down what you want to study by subject or other category.

Want to see how you're doing and what you need to spend more time on? QuizVerse can you show your study statistics and tell you which concepts you are doing better with.

With QuizVerse, you can also share a set of flashcards with your friends and classmates. If you're a teacher or professor, you can create a flashcard set to share with your students. Your shared flashcards can also be password protected for privacy.

## Product Vision Statement:
At a bare minimum, QuizVerse will allow users to create their own flashcards, and use the app to study those flashcards through the process of spaced repetition.
We will also implement a Daily Quiz feature that will quiz a user everyday, and create a rewards system to incentivize studying.

## History of the Project:

Here at QuizVerse, we are tired of the current flashcard app market. Too many are clunky and confusing, like Anki, or require a steep paywall, like Quizlet. We strive to create a more accessible, more simple, and more fun tool for studying available to any student out there.
