> Can large language models respond to questions in character, including questions that the character would not know?

## Motivation
Our project goal is to create a chat bot based on either a fictional or real individual that would be able to respond true to character. Many models are pretrained on large corpuses that fall outside of the information scope of the actual character or individual and we hope to remedy that problem.\\
In recent years, with the release of ChatGPT, large language models have been used in all different types of fields and businesses. One such use of large language models has been to replicate the personality and knowledge of certain fictional characters. People have trained numerous models with the dialogue and actions of fictional characters in order to create a chat bot that can respond as their favorite character. However, many of the publicly available chatbots share the same problem: access to knowledge outside of their fictional counterpart's knowledge. As such, our objective is to refine the scope of the chat bot's knowledge and ensure that they answer questions true to character rather than defaulting to the information trained on the base model. In doing so, we hope to be able to train chat bot's on real life individuals to try to predict how a person may respond to a question or situation through training the chat bot on a person's own writing, quotes, and related works. A refined chat bot would be particularly useful to prepare for rebuttals in a debate and prepare for any questions that could potentially be asked. Creating a chat bot based solely on a single individual will also reveal some interesting questions on just how accurate a chatbot could be in replicating a person's speech and just how much of an impact a person's prior beliefs have on their present character.
