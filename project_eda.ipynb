They're keys. And I'll bet one of them fits that door. [They come upon a broomstick, suspended in the air.]\\n\", '\\n', \"Hermione: What's this all about?\\n\", '\\n', \"Harry: I don't know. Strange.\\n\", '\\n', '[Ron creeps over to the door and takes out his wand.]\\n', '\\n', 'Ron: [rattles lock.] Alohomora! [Shrugs] Well, it was worth a try.\\n', '\\n', \"Hermione: Ugh!

We've got to play our way across the room. Alright. Harry, you take the empty Bishop's square. Hermione, you'll be the Queen-side castle. As for me, I'll be a knight.

Harry turns toward the staircase into the room, wondering whether he should try to escape, then turns towards Quirrell again. He is almost finished unwrapping his turban, save for a piece covering the back of his head. Finally, he removes the turban, revealing a scary-looking chalk white face. It was Voldemort. He cranes around and opens his eyes.]\\n', 'Voldemort: Harry Potter, we meet again.\\n', 'Harry: [realizing his identity] Voldemort.\\n', \"Voldemort: Yes. You see what I've become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another. A mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can.

Harry looks on horrified as Quirrell backs up with his face horrendously burned. Quirrell crumbles as he walks forward, turning his body completely in ash and dust, and falls to the floor, leaving only his clothing. Harry gasps, as he looks at his own hands and hurries over to the stone. He picks it up and sighs. However, from behind, dust clouds form from Quirrell's corpse, causing Harry to turn around as the dust clouds with Voldemort's face rushes forward screaming and goes through Harry who also screams. Voldemort flies away, as Harry falls to the ground, unconscious. He holds the Stone in an outstretched hand.]\\n\", '\\n', 'Mark of Love\\n', '[In the hospital wing the next day, Harry is lying in bed with his arm bandaged.

They're both just fine.\\n\", 'Harry: But what happened to the Stone?\\n', 'Dumbledore: Relax, dear boy. The Stone has been destroyed.

But yes, he will die.\\n', 'Harry: How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next...\\n', 'Dumbledore: Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me that is saying something.\\n', 'Harry: Does that mean, with the Stone gone, that is, that Voldemort can never come back?\\n', \"Dumbledore: Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him? [Harry shakes his head.] It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you. And that kind of act leaves a mark. [Harry touches his scar.] No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin.\\n\", 'Harry: What is it?\\n', \"Dumbledore: Love, Harry. Love.

Earwax.\\n\", 'House Cup Winner\\n', '[Harry with his arm still bandaged enters a corridor where up on a stairwell balcony, Hermione and Ron are talking.

Hermione?\\n', 'Hermione: [smiling] Never better.\\n', '[We see the Great Hall full of students eating and talking with each other. There are green and silver banners with the Slytherin symbol above their heads, already indicating the house with the most points.

Dumbledore stands up and speaks with his magically magnified voice.]\\n', '\\n', 'Dumbledore: Another year gone. And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarding. And the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor with 312 points. [There is a medium applause from the crowd.] Third place, Hufflepuff with 352 points. [The applause for Hufflepuff is slightly louder than the clapping for Gryffindor.] In second place, Ravenclaw with 426 points. [Applause again, this time with a slight cheer from some students.] And in first place, with 472 points, Slytherin house.

Malfoy looks quite uncertain now.] Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of decoration is in order.

      "It is nighttime in Surrey, we see an owl on the street sign \"PRIVET DRIVE\" and the camera pans to the street with very identical looking brown bricked houses. The owl flies away and an elderly man with crimson robes and a long silvery white beard named Albus Dumbledore walks out of a forest near the street, past a tabby cat standing next to what looks like a shed. He takes out his deluminator and activates it. Dumbledore zaps all the light out of the lampposts. He puts away the device and a cat meows. Dumbledore looks down at the cat.\n",
      "The cat silently looks at him, and the camera turns towards a wall. The cat's shadow turns into a woman with a tall hat and emerald robes. There are footsteps and Minerva McGonagall is revealed.\n",
      "There is a motor sound, and the two professors look up to see a flying motorcycle coming down from the air. It skids on the street and halts. A large man with shoulder length black hair and beard named Rubeus Hagrid takes off his goggles.\n",
      "Hagrid hands a baby wrapped in a bundle over to Dumbledore.\n",
      "They stop outside a house which is 4 Privet Drive.\n",
      "Dumbledore places the baby on the ground slowly. Hagrid sniffles, he is sobbing a little. He clears his throat.\n",
      "Hagrid nods. Dumbledore takes a letter and places it on the baby, who is now at the foot of the door.\n",
      "The baby has a lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead. The camera slowly zooms towards the scar which glows brightly and it immediately flashes, transitioning to a stormy cloud sky. The film's title in metallic gold zooms out around the camera, and lightning flashes to brighten it up. Then, the lightning flashes engulf the screen, transitioning it to the present time.\n",
      "The scar's glow immediately dies down, and the camera pans to see Harry who is now 10 years old, still sleeping. Then, the light turns on outside his bedroom cupboard under the stairs\n",
      "Harry wakes up, turns on his bedroom light and puts on his glasses with tape on the bridge, indicating that it was partly damaged. A large, tubby boy, Dudley Dursley, suddenly comes running down the stairs above the closet. He stops half-way down and goes back, jumping on the staircase.\n",
      "Harry looks up to the join works of the stairs with small amounts of dusts rising. Dudley laughs, comes down the stairs, and runs for the kitchen. Harry tries to come out of the closet but is pushed back in by Dudley. Petunia is in the kitchen, where Dudley has gone.\n",
      "Petunia and Dudley giggle together. Harry comes into the kitchen, dressed in outgrown clothes.\n",
      "Harry then gets to work on cooking the bacon\n",
      "Petunia leads Dudley over to the family room, where there are a vast amount of presents. Dudley stares.\n",
      "Outside the house morning. The happy family is heading to the car.\n",
      "Harry then goes to go in the car, but Vernon stops him, pointing his keys at him.\n",
      "At the London Zoo, the Dursley family is in the reptile house, looking at a large Boa constrictor.\n",
      "Vernon taps the glass of the cage.\n",
      "Dudley taps the glass much harder, and Vernon nervously winces.\n",
      "Dudley and his parents head over to another enclosure. Harry is left with the snake.\n",
      "The now awake snake has attracted Dudley's attention. He comes over to the glass, knocking Harry to the floor.\n",
      "Dudley puts his hands on the glass wall. With his back turned, Harry glares at him. Suddenly, the glass disappears, causing Dudley to wretch forward, losing his balance.\n",
      "Dudley falls into the snake enclosure, sputtering in a pool of water. Harry snickers at what he saw. The snake gets out of the exhibit, stopping in front of Harry.\n",
      "The snake slivers off to the exit.\n",
      "There is a lot of people screaming throughout the reptile house as the snake heads for freedom. Dudley gets up to get out, but the glass is now back over the enclosure. Seeing that he is now trapped, he pounds the glass in panic.\n",
      "Harry grins and snickers, Vernon notices this and glares down at him. Harry's grin disappears, knowing that he is in trouble with Vernon.\n",
      "Back at the Dursleys'. Petunia and a bundled up Dudley come in.\n",
      "They walk in the living room. Harry and Vernon enter. Vernon slams the door and shoves Harry against a wall, taking his hair.\n",
      "Vernon scoffs at this, shoves Harry in the cupboard under the stairs and slams the door\n",
      "An owl flies into view and lands itself on a TV aerial on one of the houses' roof\n",
      "The camera slowly pans up to reveal Dudley in his smartest school uniform, posing and smiling grandly.\n",
      "They draw their attention to Harry\n",
      "They laugh in amusement\n",
      "Harry leaves the living room area into the hallway and picks up some letters, one of which had his name on it with his address of where he slept. Uncle Vernon and Dudley sit at the table while Aunt Petunia is busy fixing breakfast. Harry walks in with the mail and hands it to Uncle Vernon, then walks to his seat with his letter.\n",
      "Dudley suddenly notices Harry's letter and runs to grab it from him and give it to his father.\n",
      "The family gathers to look at the address. There is a broken seal on the letter. The family looks up and Harry gulps. Much later, another owl flies by with a letter and drops it off. Inside, Vernon grabs a handful of letters and rips them up. In the closet, Harry hears a whirring noise. He looks out at Vernon drilling wood over the letterbox opening.\n",
      "Harry quietly closes the cupboard door. The next day, Vernon and Petunia are outside the door. Vernon is about to head off to work. Petunia kisses his cheek.\n",
      "She stops, looks and sees a bunch of owls.\n",
      "She notices something and pats Vernon on the shoulder to get his attention, and what they see is more letters addressed to Harry.\n",
      "Later, Petunia is cracking a egg into a bowl, and what instead comes out is a folded-up letter. She cracks another one, but another letter comes out as well. She then cracks yet another one, but the same happens again. She stares at the letter, and then she hears the owls screeching. She draws her attention to the outside of the window, and what she sees is four owls sitting on some garden chairs. Petunia then screams and runs off.\n",
      "Much later, Vernon is tossing letters into the fireplace. Harry comes around the corner. Vernon grins evilly and tosses more in. The scene fades to the next day, the family is sitting around, Harry is serving cookies.\n",
      "As Vernon was talking, a letter shoots out of the fireplace and zips across Vernon's face, cutting him off. There is a rumbling and then millions of letters come shooting out of the fireplace. The family shrieks in horror as Harry watches in amazement.\n",
      "Harry jumps onto the coffee table to grab a letter. He gets one and starts to run away. Vernon jumps up as well.\n",
      "He chases Harry and grabs him before Harry gets into his closet.\n",
      "Vernon restrains Harry as several letters begin to shoot everywhere around the house.\n",
      "The wood plank nailed in front of the letterbox finally breaks from the excess pressure of the letters shooting through the letter.\n",
      "Petunia watches with a horrified look on her face, knowing that Dudley may be right.\n",
      "That stormy night, a tall house, on a rock island somewhere out at sea. The Dursleys, including Harry have moved there, due to the chaos with the letters. The family is sleeping, with Harry on the cold, dirt floor and Dudley sleeping on a sofa. Harry has drawn a birthday cake which reads, Happy Birthday Harry. Harry looks at Dudley's watch, which beeps 12:00.\n",
      "Suddenly, the door thumps, in sync with the thunder flashing. Harry jumps. The door thumps again and Dudley and Harry jump up and back away. Harry hides behind a wall, and Dudley cowers on a windowsill. Petunia and Vernon appear, with Vernon holding a double barrel gun.\n",
      "The door bangs again and then falls down, and a giant man appears. As he comes into the clear lighting, the giant man himself reveals to be Rubeus Hagrid.\n",
      "As Petunia quietly gasps in fear, Hagrid grabs the gun and bends it upwards.\n",
      "Harry reveals himself\n",
      "Hagrid hands Harry the cake\n",
      "Harry opens cake, which reads \"Happee Birthdae Harry\" in green frosting.\n",
      "Hagrid sits down on the sofa, takes out an umbrella, and points it at the empty fire. Two sparks fly out of the umbrella and start a fire. The Dursley family gasps.\n",
      "Harry looks confused\n",
      "Dudley whimpers. Hagrid hands Harry the same letter that has been sent the past while. Harry opens it and he began to read.\n",
      "As the Dursleys argue with Hagrid, no one, including Harry, is noticing Dudley taking Harry's cake away\n",
      "Harry smiles upon hearing Dumbledore's name\n",
      "Hagrid whips out his umbrella and points it at Vernon, threateningly.\n",
      "Hagrid finally sees Dudley eating Harry's cake and aims his umbrella at his buttock. He fires a magic spark at it, causing a grey tail to grow.\n",
      "The Dursleys shriek in both fright and horror as they run off out of sight. Harry laughs at this, so does Hagrid.\n",
      "He walks out. Harry grins, looks back at the direction where the Dursleys are gone, and grins again, before grabbing his jacket and joins Hagrid on their journey to London.\n",
      "The next day, in the streets of London.\n",
      "Harry and Hagrid are in the underground tube.\n",
      "The next scene, Hagrid and Harry are walking down the streets.\n",
      "They walk towards a corner store and as they get closer, the sign above it has “The Leaky Cauldron” magically appearing. They enter the Leaky Cauldron. There was music and several patrons that are speaking to each other.\n",
      "The pub immediately goes silent and everyone notices. A man comes up and shakes Harry's hand.\n",
      "A witch comes up and shakes Harry's hand, as well.\n",
      "A man in robes with a turban on his head appears. It is Professor Quirrell.\n",
      "The two leave into a back room winery in front of a brick wall.\n",
      "Harry is amazed as they pass by shops and owls and bats. The camera pans on a broom store, where a group of boys are crowded around a shiny broom.\n",
      "Harry and Hagrid continue walking down Diagon Alley\n",
      "Inside the bank, they walk down the shiny aisle, passing tiny creatures working at their desks.\n",
      "The goblin looks up.\n",
      "Later, they race down the depth caverns in a cartlike structure. The cart stops, and a goblin, called Griphook, clambers out.\n",
      "Hagrid hands him the key and Griphook unlocks the vault. The room is filled nearly top to bottom with coins. Harry is amazed.\n",
      "They continue on through the cavern.\n",
      "Harry nods in agreement\n",
      "Outside back in Diagon Alley, Harry and Hagrid are walking through the street. Harry has bought most of his equipment, and is reading his list.\n",
      "Harry goes into the store, quietly. He looks around. There are shelves of wands in boxes, but no people.\n",
      "Then, a noise came from the back, and a man appears on a ladder and looks at Harry. The man is Ollivander and he smiles.\n",
      "Harry then hears a knock on the window.\n",
      "Later back in the Leaky Cauldron, Hagrid and Harry, are at a long table, eating soup. Everything is too quiet, Hagrid soon notices this.\n",
      "Harry looks around to see if anyone heard it\n",
      "We flash back to the present time.\n",
      "At King's Cross Station, up on a crossing bridge, Harry, with his cart of his baggage, equipment and Hedwig, walks beside Hagrid. A couple look at Hagrid, suspiciously.\n",
      "Harry looks at his ticket.\n",
      "Harry is walking down a lane between trains. A man rushes by.\n",
      "Harry sees a guard.\n",
      "Harry then notices a woman, daughter, and four boys walk by, pushing carts.\n",
      "A tall boy with red hair, called Percy, comes forward and runs towards a brick wall. Amazingly, he disappears right into it. Harry is amazed.\n",
      "Fred moves towards the wall\n",
      "Harry takes a breath and runs at the wall. He shuts his eyes and emerges on the other side a magnificent station at Platform 9¾ with a red train, which is the Hogwarts Express, and bundles of people. A whistle blows, and Harry sighs with relief.\n",
      "Later on, the Hogwarts Express is travelling through the countryside. Harry is in sitting alone in a train compartment, and Ron appears in the doorway.\n",
      "Ron goes agape.\n",
      "A trolley comes by the compartment, full of sweets.\n",
      "A bit later, Harry and Ron are not sitting together eating bundles of sweets. Ron's rat, Scabbers, is perched on Ron's knee, a box over his head.\n",
      "Harry quickly takes the bean he was chewing out of his mouth.\n",
      "Harry looks at the card again, but Dumbledore has vanished.\n",
      "A girl called Hermione Granger, with bushy brown hair, dressed in robes, appears at the doorway.\n",
      "He zaps Scabbers, but nothing happens. Ron shrugs.\n",
      "It is nighttime at Hogsmeade station, the train blows its whistle and pulls into outside the station. Hagrid walks along the side aisle, with a lantern. People, in their robes, begin pouring out of the train.\n",
      "Harry and Ron, now in their robes, walk up to Hagrid.\n",
      "Later, a large number of boats are plugging across a vast lake, where up ahead there is a huge castle, known as the Hogwarts Castle, can be seen. People are in awe.\n",
      "They continue on further towards the castle. Later on, the first-year students walk in the castle, and up the staircase. As the camera pans, we see on a higher level, Professor McGonagall is waiting. She taps her fingers on a stone railing, and then goes to the top of the stairs to greet the newcomers.\n",
      "A scared looking boy called Neville Longbottom, spots his toad sitting near McGonagall. He jumps forward.\n",
      "A young evil looking boy, with short blonde hair, called Draco Malfoy, speaks up.\n",
      "Draco glares. McGonagall returns and taps Draco on the shoulder with a paper. He leaves Harry with one last glare.\n",
      "Professor McGonagall leads everyone through two large doors which go to the Great Hall, where there are four long tables with thousands of students, as well as floating candles. The roof appears to be the sky.\n",
      "McGonagall leads the first years to the front where the Sorting Hat lies on the stool.\n",
      "Dumbledore rises from the main table.\n",
      "Harry nods in agreement. Hermione sits on the stool and McGonagall places the sorting hat on her head\n",
      "The students cheer; Hermione jumps off with a smile.\n",
      "Draco saunters up proudly. The tattered hat nearly freaks before touching down on Draco's head.\n",
      "The students cheer, not as loudly\n",
      "A small redhead, named Susan Bones, walks up to the Sorting Hat. Harry looks around and notices a black greasy haired, pale man, called Severus Snape, giving him sinister looks. His scar hurts.\n",
      "Ron gulps and walks up. He sits down and the hat is put on.\n",
      "The students cheer as Ron sighs in relief.\n",
      "Everything goes silent. Harry walks up and sits down on the stool. The Sorting Hat is placed on his head.\n",
      "There is an immense cheering and Harry gets sent to the Gryffindor table.\n",
      "Harry sits down at the table. He looks at Dumbledore, who lifts up his goblet and slightly waves it, as if he was wishing congratulations.\n",
      "Later, when all of the first years are sorted in their houses, all of the students were talking to each other. McGonagall dings on a cup.\n",
      "From the aerial view of the Great Hall, food magically appears on all the tables, and the hall is filled with awe and chatter.\n",
      "Draco looks at all the food, raises his eyebrows and digs in. Ron stuffs his face.\n",
      "Neville laughs. Harry is sitting next to Percy. He leans over.\n",
      "Ron, having just finished a chicken wing, reaches into the bowl for more, and a ghost, called Sir Nicolas, pops out.\n",
      "Numerous ghosts come pouring from the walls, sailing along.\n",
      "Hermione moans in disgust; Harry just simply rolls his eyes. Nick reattaches his head back to his body. Later, Percy is leading the Gryffindors to the staircase tower.\n",
      "The camera pans up and we see a vast amount of staircases, people walking on them, and some switching places.\n",
      "They begin walking up the stairs, several of the portraits began greeting them\n",
      "A bit later on the seventh floor, the students in the corridor leading to Gryffindor Tower. They come up to a large painting of a large woman in a pink dress. She is known as \"The Fat Lady\".\n",
      "Later at midnight. Harry is sitting by a window in his pj's, with Hedwig. He pets the owl and looks out the window, sighing with content, knowing that he will love it here at Hogwarts.\n",
      "It is morning at Hogwarts, and Harry and Ron are running in the corridors because they're late for Transfiguration class. In the class, a tabby cat is sitting on a desk. Harry and Ron rush in; Hermione rolls her eyes in annoyance because they're late for class.\n",
      "The cat jumps off the desk and transforms into Professor McGonagall, on-screen for the first time. The two boys are amazed.\n",
      "Later on, inside Snape's potions classroom, the students are chattering, sitting near steaming cauldrons. The door slams open and Snape comes rushing in.\n",
      "Hermione looks a bit surprised as everyone laughs\n",
      "Harry stares at Snape, knowing that he shows dislike for the boy. In the great hall, around midday. The students are all doing their homework. Seamus is trying a spell on a cup.\n",
      "Ron was cut off when a mighty flash occurs. We now see that the cup has exploded and Seamus is left charred. Several students laugh at this as Hermione fans away the smoke with her hand. Suddenly, a flock of owls start coming into the hall from the rafters above.\n",
      "The owls soar by, dropping parcels to students. Harry gets nothing. He sees the newspaper Ron has put down.\n",
      "Neville is unwrapping a gift. It is a clear glass ball with a gold banner around it.\n",
      "That afternoon, outside the castle, the students, Gryffindor and Slytherin, are lined up in two rows with brooms by their sides. The teacher, Madam Hooch, comes down the line. She has short hair and hawk yellow eyes.\n",
      "After Harry said \"Up\"!, the broom immediately flies into his hand.\n",
      "Hermione stares at him as the class continues.\n",
      "She blows the whistle. However, Neville's broomstick somehow lifts him off the ground. Neville immediately lifts off. He looks quite frightened.\n",
      "he immediately skyrockets towards the sky\n",
      "He flies uncontrollably in the air and hits a wall, conking along it and then swooping off. All the while, he is screaming. He begins to zoom back towards the group of students. Hooch quickly holds out her wand to stop him.\n",
      "Hooch is helping Neville up; he has broken his wrist after he fell.\n",
      "Finally having enough, Harry gets on his broom, Hermione stops him.\n",
      "Harry is now in the air, across from Draco.\n",
      "Draco hurls the Remembrall into the air, like a baseball. Harry zooms after the ball, speeding towards a tower. Just as he is about to hit a window, from which McGonagall is working, he catches it. McGonagall notices this and looks surprised as Harry begins to fly back down to the grounds. The students all cheer as Harry lands back on the ground at ease. They run to see him.\n",
      "McGonagall appears in the grounds.\n",
      "McGonagall and Harry arrive outside of Professor Quirrell's classroom. He is inside teaching, holding an iguana.\n",
      "Harry and Ron are walking through crowded halls. Sir Nicholas and a lady ghost float by.\n",
      "Fred and George approach and walk along with Ron and Harry.\n",
      "Hermione, knowing what Harry is talking about, jumps up from her work and comes to join them.\n",
      "Later, the three approach a trophy case. Hermione points at a plaque of Quidditch players. One lists Harry's father as a Seeker.\n",
      "The three are walking up a staircase in the Grand Staircase tower. A railing pulls in, Hermione looks, but continues walking.\n",
      "The staircase shudders and begins to move. The three grab the railings.\n",
      "Hermione gasps\n",
      "They all open a door and walk into a spooky, dark, and deserted corridor.\n",
      "Suddenly, a flame lights on a tall stone support. At that moment, Filch's cat, Mrs. Norris, comes running in and meows. The group jumps.\n",
      "Mrs. Norris meows\n",
      "The trio run through the corridor, flames are lit up on the stone supports, one by one, as they run past. They get to the end of the corridor, to a door.\n",
      "Harry grabs the handle, but it's locked.\n",
      "Filch arrives at the start of the corridor with a light. Mrs. Norris looks at him.\n",
      "They return to the Gryffindor Common Room. They are breathless.\n",
      "Harry nods in agreement\n",
      "Outside in the courtyard, day time. Oliver and Harry appear, carrying a trunk. They put it down.\n",
      "The ball flutters out two delicate wings and jumps into the air. Harry keeps an eye on it.\n",
      "In Professor Flitwick's class. Filtwick is very short, and is standing on a bunch of books to make up for his stature and to see his class.\n",
      "The class begin to enunciate and doing the movements on their feathers\n",
      "Hermione straightens up and swishes her wand.\n",
      "Ron puts his head on his books dejectedly. Seamus begins swishing at his feather.\n",
      "An almighty explosion flashes. Flitwick gasps, as Ron and Hermione turn to the source of the explosion\n",
      "We see that Seamus is charred again with his feather, now smoldering to ashes.\n",
      "Neville, Harry, Ron and Seamus are walking through a courtyard with other students all around.\n",
      "Hermione rushes past Ron, hugging her books and sniffling in tears.\n",
      "Hermione disappears into the crowd, deeply hurt by Ron's words.\n",
      "That Halloween night, the great hall has floating Jack O'Lanterns in place of the candles. Harry notices an empty spot on the bench.\n",
      "Harry glances at Ron with a disapproving look on his face; Ron shrugs. Suddenly, Professor Quirrell comes running into the Great Hall in panic.\n",
      "Quirrell passes out in fear. The great hall goes silent, and then everyone freaks out, screaming and running.\n",
      "Snape looks aghast, and he walks out through a doorway. A bit later, Percy is leading the Gryffindors down a dark corridor.\n",
      "The two separate themselves from the crowd. They run down corridors. They start running down a hall when they stop because there's a grunting noise coming from a large shadow on the wall.\n",
      "Harry pulls Ron into a doorway, they peer out to see a large, ugly troll thunks by into a room.\n",
      "In the girl's bathroom, Hermione emerges from a stall, wiping her eyes. She stops when she sees something. The troll is standing there. Hermione backs up into the stall just as the troll raises its club and smashes the top part of the stalls. Hermione screams in terror. Harry and Ron come bursting in.\n",
      "The troll smashes the remaining stalls.\n",
      "Harry gets out his wand. He runs forward and grabs the troll's club and is lifted up.\n",
      "Harry's wand shoots up the troll's nose. The troll groans in disgust.\n",
      "Ron and Hermione were disgusted by Harry’s wand in the troll’s nose. The troll snorts, and whips around.\n",
      "The troll gets Harry off its shoulders and is holding him by one leg, upside down.\n",
      "It gears up its club and swipes at Harry. He pulls himself up, then down.\n",
      "Ron grabs his wand. Under the sink, Hermione waves her hand.\n",
      "Harry wipes his wand on his robes. Suddenly, McGonagall, Snape and Quirrell come rushing in. They all gasp at the knocked out troll.\n",
      "Snape and McGonagall leave the bathroom\n",
      "Harry, Ron and Hermione are walking back to the Gryffindor Common Room through the corridor.\n",
      "Hermione looks at Ron.\n",
      "They both smile at each other as they carry on through the corridor.\n",
      "The next morning, in the great hall. The gang is sitting, eating. Harry is twirling his food on a fork.\n",
      "Snape appears at the table.\n",
      "Hedwig screeches as she enters the Great Hall. She is carrying a very large, long parcel. She drops it off at the table.\n",
      "They open it to reveal a broomstick.\n",
      "He notices Professor McGonagall up at the head table, stroking Hedwig. She smiles and Harry nods.] [Later on, inside a Quidditch tower, the Gryffindor team is marching toward the starting gate. They reach it and stop, behind a closed double door.\n",
      "Harry gulps and looks straight ahead as the doors open. They mount their brooms and zoom out onto the enormous pitch. There is cheering. Lee Jordan, the Quidditch commentator is announcing from a tower.\n",
      "There is a close-up of Gryffindor students cheering.\n",
      "The players take their positions in the air in a circle. Harry weaves in, highest amongst. He looks down.\n",
      "The Snitch zooms around each Seeker's head, then disappears. Hooch grabs the Quaffle.\n",
      "Gryffindor takes possession of the ball and a chaser, Angelia Johnson, zooms past the Slytherins towards their goal, and throws the ball, and scores! There is a ding.\n",
      "Harry, in the air, claps.\n",
      "In the stands, Gryffindor cheers.\n",
      "Flint dodges people and throws for the Gryffindor hoops. Oliver appears and whacks the ball away with his broom. He smirks at Flint, who glares. Johnson and Katie Bell pass the Quaffle back and forth as they strategize to score. Johnson takes it, throws, and once again scores!\n",
      "The Slytherins decide to get messy. They dodge, kick, and try to score. Once again, Oliver blocks.\n",
      "This causes the entire audience to boo; Harry is visibly upset as the Slytherins laugh. The Slytherin members head off. One jumps over George (or Fred) and scores. Lee adds 10 points in the plaque with Slytherin's name. Harry is upset again. Slytherin cheers.\n",
      "They box Johnson in and sent her into the capes covering one of the towers. She falls down in and is out. The crowd boos. Slytherin scores once again.\n",
      "Suddenly, Harry sees the Snitch. He starts to head off after it and then suddenly his broom starts bucking and turning.\n",
      "Hermione looks through binoculars at Harry, then at Snape, who is visibly muttering.\n",
      "Harry is knocked and thrown around, then falls, dangling by one arm from the broom.\n",
      "Hermione is hurrying up in the tower structures. She appears underneath Snape and touches his cloak with her wand.\n",
      "A spark ignites and Snape's cloak catches fire. Hermione quickly leaves.\n",
      "Harry rams the Slytherin Seeker, then is butted out. He returns, smashing the Seeker again as the Snitch dives. The boys follow, but they approach the ground quickly. The Slytherin Seeker backs out, and Harry pulls up his broom as he follows the Snitch, feet above the ground. Harry stands up, and steps forward, trying to grab the ball. He goes too far, and topples off the broom with a yelp, tumbling on the ground. He gets up and lurches. The crowd gasps. Hermione appears beside a tower to see.\n",
      "Harry lurches and the Snitch pops out of his mouth. It lands in his hands.\n",
      "The crowd cheers in joy including Gryffindor\n",
      "McGonagall giggles happily. Harry raises the Snitch into the air and the crowd, and his team, cheers.\n",
      "Harry, Hermione and Ron are walking along a path with Hagrid, talking.\n",
      "He then leaves, mumbling to himself \"I should have not said that\"\n",
      "It is now Christmas at Hogwarts, with snow falling. Hagrid is dragging a massive Christmas tree to the castle. Hermione walks to the Great Hall entrance with her luggage and wearing a scarf as the ghosts are singing Christmas songs.\n",
      "Hermione looks from the massive Christmas tree as Flitwick uses his wand to put another ornament on the tree to Harry and Ron as they play Chess and walks towards them.\n",
      "Hermione watches as Ron's queen goes over to Harry's knight and whacks the knight with her chair. Ron grins.\n",
      "It is now Christmas morning. Ron is waking Harry up\n",
      "Harry puts on his glasses and runs out of bed. He then looks down at Ron\n",
      "Harry runs down the staircase to see his presents\n",
      "Harry sees a note on the present and opens it, reading it out\n",
      "Harry then proceeds to open the remaining of his present. He pulls out a blanket-like object\n",
      "Harry then wraps the cloak around his shoulders, making his body invisible\n",
      "Late that night, a lantern and hand appear, but nothing else. The ensemble walks through the dark library and into the Restricted Section. The lamp is put down, and the cloak removed, revealing to be Harry who searches the bookshelves.\n",
      "Harry picks up a book and opens it. A man's face appears from between the pages, which screams madly and loudly. Harry immediately slams the book shut and puts it back.\n",
      "Harry runs from the room, breathing heavily. He exits into the hall, where Mrs. Norris, who meows and begins to follow him. Harry runs around a corner, just as Snape and Quirrell appear. Snape pushes Quirrell into the wall.\n",
      "Filch arrives, carrying the broken lantern.\n",
      "Upon hearing this, Snape and Quirrell dart off\n",
      "A door opens and then it closes. On the other side, there is a vast, empty room that has a large mirror in the center known as the Mirror of Erised. Harry appears and walks over to the mirror. In the reflection, he sees two people appear who are Harry's late parents, James and Lily Potter.\n",
      "Back in the boy's dormitory in Gryffindor tower, Harry comes whipping in, invisible.\n",
      "Back in the room. Harry and Ron appear as if magically and Harry runs to the mirror.\n",
      "One day, in the Great Hall where most of the students, particularly the Weasleys are eating, Harry sits in front of the fireplace.\n",
      "Harry nods and Ron leaves to go back to the table as Harry continues to stare at the fireplace.\n",
      "The next night, Harry is back in the room where the mirror is, gazing longingly at the reflection where his parents are in. Dumbledore appears far behind him\n",
      "It is snowy in daytime, Harry is out in a main courtyard, bundled up, with Hedwig on his arm. He stops and she lifts off, soaring away into the sky. As the time passed when she returns, it is now spring time.\n",
      "Just then, Neville Longbottom comes hopping into the Great Hall with his legs stuck together as the other students laugh at him.\n",
      "the Trio tears out of the Great Hall, leaving poor Neville still flailing around\n",
      "In the library, Harry and Ron are seated, reading until Hermione comes up with a huge book and thumps it onto the table making Harry jump.\n",
      "They all look at each other in concern. It is nighttime in the castle grounds, and Hermione, Ron, and Harry are running across to Hagrid's hut. They knock on the door and Hagrid, who is wearing an apron and oven mitts, opens it from the inside.\n",
      "He begins to close the door\n",
      "Hagrid opens the door again\n",
      "They all come into Hagrid's hut.\n",
      "The egg rattles and cracks open as pieces fly off; a small baby dragon emerges. It squeaks and slips on an egg piece.\n",
      "Norbert squeaks as it looks at Hagrid.\n",
      "Norbert backs away, until he hiccups and blast a small fireball into Hagrid's beard.\n",
      "Harry, Ron, and Hermione are walking back through a corridor as an owl screeches.\n",
      "They stop as McGonagall, in her nightgown, appears, sternly.\n",
      "Then, Malfoy appears smugly beside her. Inside McGonagall's classroom, the three are now standing in front of McGonagall's desk, while Malfoy is feet away, smirking.\n",
      "Malfoy nods, then his smile vanishes with great concern.\n",
      "Harry, Ron and Hermione grin, as Draco sags, knowing that the tables have turned.\n",
      "The next night, Harry, Ron, Hermione and Draco are being led to Hagrid's hut by Mr. Filch.\n",
      "In the Forbidden Forest, the group walks along a path to a tree. Hagrid stops, bends down and dips his fingers in a silver puddle. He pulls out his fingers and rubs them together. A silver trail smears with his fingers.\n",
      "Harry and Draco are walking through a part of the forest, with Fang leading. Draco has the lamp in his hand.\n",
      "Harry and Draco approach a flat ground with gnarled roots all over. Fang stops, then growls.\n",
      "Up ahead is a cloaked figure who is crouching over a dead unicorn, drinking its blood from its wound. The figure raises its head, silver blood dripping from its mouth. Harry gasps and grabs his scar, which is hurting. Draco screams with pure fear and runs away with Fang.\n",
      "Harry is left by himself at the mercy of the figure who slides over the unicorn and rises erect. It advances towards Harry, who backs up, but trips. He crawls backwards. Suddenly, there is the sound of hoof-beats. A figure leaps over Harry and lands near the cloaked figure. It is a silver centaur called Firenze. It rears, and the cloaked figure retreats, flying away.\n",
      "Fang suddenly barks and Harry looks up to see Hagrid, Hermione, Ron and Draco appear. Hagrid has his crossbow ready but lowers it when he sees Firenze.\n",
      "He leaves as the group look at the dead unicorn.\n",
      "Later all the students are rushing out as they finish their exams.\n",
      "We see Harry walking next to the two rubbing his forehead right where the scar is.\n",
      "Harry starts walking faster making Hermione and Ron speed up to catch him\n",
      "They approach Hagrid's hut who is playing a flute.\n",
      "Harry, Hermione, and Ron run into the Transfiguration classroom to talk to McGonagall.\n",
      "The three of them leave the classroom talking to each other.\n",
      "Snape sneaks up behind them\n",
      "The three of them jump and quickly turn around.\n",
      "At nighttime, in the Gryffindor Common Room, the three friends come down the stairs and begin to walk across the floor. They stop when they hear a croaking noise. It was Trevor, the toad that Neville carried in his hands, way back at the first day of Hogwarts.\n",
      "Neville is frozen for a second and he falls backward onto the ground. Hermione puts her wand back.\n",
      "The three are under the Invisibility cloak, sneaking along the corridor.\n",

      "They enter into a room filled with golden \"birds.\"\n",
      "Ron creeps over to the door and takes out his wand.\n",
      "Harry nods and grabs the broomstick. All the keys suddenly go one direction, right at Harry. He climbs on, swiping at them.\n",
      "Harry pushes off into the air. He flies off, after the key. The others follow him. Harry grabs the key.\n",
      "He zooms by and throws the key to Hermione, who catches it and heads for the lock while Harry distracts the other keys. Hermione puts it in the lock.\n",
      "The door opens, and Hermione and Ron rush through, followed by Harry. They shut the door just as the keys slam up against it.\n",
      "They enter a dark room with broken pieces all around it.\n",
      "They walk across the board, towards the door. Suddenly, as they reach a line of pawns, the pawns bring up their swords. The three jump and back up.\n",

      "The Queen turns again. Both Ron and Harry study the game.\n",
      "Ron's horse moves forward, slides and stops.\n",
      "The Queen turns and advances. As she starts moving, Ron breathes faster clutching onto the steel reins. The Queen stops moving. And then... SMASH! The Queen uses her sword to bust the horse's hips. Ron goes flying off the horse and lands on the floor unconsciously. The knight's horse then falls to pieces.\n",
      "Harry nods and stands, walking away.\n",
      "Harry walks down the stairs slowly. Halfway down, he winces, feeling his scar burning, and sees Professor Quirrell standing before the Mirror of Erised.\n",
      "Quirrell reaches up and starts unwrapping his turban as he turns so his back is to the mirror. Harry turns toward the staircase into the room, wondering whether he should try to escape, then turns towards Quirrell again. He is almost finished unwrapping his turban, save for a piece covering the back of his head. Finally, he removes the turban, revealing a scary-looking chalk white face. It was Voldemort. He cranes around and opens his eyes.\n",
      "Under orders, Quirrell soars into the air and grabs hold of Harry with one hand on his throat. They fall to the steps, causing the Stone falls out of Harry's reach as Quirrell chokes him. Harry strains and squeaks. Suddenly, Harry puts his hand on Quirrell's hand in an attempt to get him off. Smoke furls from under his hand as Quirrell winces.\n",
      "Quirrell walks forward towards Harry, who then touches his face with his hands, causing Quirrell to scream in pain, and especially Voldemort to wince. Harry looks on horrified as Quirrell backs up with his face horrendously burned. Quirrell crumbles as he walks forward, turning his body completely in ash and dust, and falls to the floor, leaving only his clothing. Harry gasps, as he looks at his own hands and hurries over to the stone. He picks it up and sighs. However, from behind, dust clouds form from Quirrell's corpse, causing Harry to turn around as the dust clouds with Voldemort's face rushes forward screaming and goes through Harry who also screams. Voldemort flies away, as Harry falls to the ground, unconscious. He holds the Stone in an outstretched hand.\n",
      "In the hospital wing the next day, Harry is lying in bed with his arm bandaged. He awakens, puts on his glasses, and sits up. There are cards and candy all over. Dumbledore approaches him.\n",
      "Harry with his arm still bandaged enters a corridor where up on a stairwell balcony, Hermione and Ron are talking. They stop when they see Harry and lean over the railing.\n",
      "We see the Great Hall full of students eating and talking with each other. There are green and silver banners with the Slytherin symbol above their heads, already indicating the house with the most points. Dumbledore gives a slight nod to Professor McGonagall, who then clinks her spoon to her glass to ask attention from the students. The crowd falls silent. Dumbledore stands up and speaks with his magically magnified voice.\n",
      "The Gryffindors cheer again, this time even louder than before. Malfoy has a cringing look on his face, while Harry sees a proud, smiling Professor McGonagall at the teacher's table. Hermione, who has done some quick math, whispers to her fellow students.\n",
      "Now, the Gryffindors look really hopeful, as Dumbledore hasn't finished talking yet.\n",
      "The Great Hall explodes with applause, not only from the Gryffindors, but also from the Ravenclaws and the Hufflepuffs because they are glad that for the first time in seven years, someone other than Slytherin has won the House Cup. Hagrid can't help himself to also cheer, and all students except the Slytherins throw their hats in the air, while Malfoy angrily throws his on the table in defeat. The Gryffindors around Harry are all congratulating him, and Harry smiles to Hagrid, who smiles back.\n",
      "At Hogsmeade station, students are walking around, getting in the train.\n",
      "Harry hands Hedwig to a train man and walks to an open door of the train with Hermione. Hermione waves to Hagrid, who waves back. Hermione gets on the train.\n",
      "Harry opens the album and sees a picture, moving, of him as a baby with his parents. They are all smiling and waving. Harry smiles.\n",
      "Harry walks away, back to the train door where Hermione and Ron are waiting.\n",
      "The train whistles and they climb aboard. As the train starts to leave and the camera pans up over the whole scene, Harry waves out the window to Hagrid, who waves back and then waves more to other students as the camera pans far back, then the credits begin.\n",

      "Ollivander: I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter. It seems only yesterday that your mother and father were in here buying their first wands. [Picks a wand] Ah. Here we are. [Harry holds it, but does nothing] Well, give it a wave. [Harry is hesitant, but waves. This causes most of the boxes to come flying out and crashing down. Harry jumps and hurriedly puts the wand back on the counter.] Apparently not. [Ollivander gets another wand from a box.] Perhaps this. [Harry waves at a vase, which shatters, startling Harry.] No, no, definitely not! No matter. [gets a wand from a box but stops and becomes thoughtful] I wonder... [Ollivander hands the wand to Harry. No sooner after he touched it, Harry suddenly glows under it, blowing his hair up and several of the paperwork in the background. Ollivander looked a bit surprised and deep in thought.] Curious. Very curious.\n",
      "Harry: Sorry, but what's curious?\n",
      "Ollivander: [examining the wand he gave to Harry] I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It just so happens that the phoenix, whose tail feather resides in your wand gave another feather, just one other. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar. [Points to the lighting bolt scar on Harry's forehead]\n",
      "Harry: And who owned that wand?\n",
      "Ollivander: We do not speak his name. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why. But I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things. Terrible, yes, but great. [he hands Harry back his wand.]\n",

Hagrid narrates.] Voldemort started to gather some followers, brought 'em over to the dark side. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Your parents fought against him, but nobody lived once he decided to kill 'em. [Harry's mother, Lily, screams in pain as she is killed by Voldemort's wand.

      "Hagrid: What're you looking at? [He then checks watch] Blimey, is that the time? Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you. Dumbledore will be wanting his, uh... well, he'll be wanting to see me. Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes. Here's your ticket. [hands the train ticket] Stick to it, Harry, that's very important. Stick to your ticket.\n",
      "Harry: \"Platform 9¾?\" But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says Platform 9¾. There's no such thing, is there? [Harry looks up, but we now see that Hagrid has vanished and Harry all alone with his cart.]\n",

      "Harry: Excuse me, excuse me.\n",

      "Fred: I'm only joking. I am Fred. [He runs through the wall and is followed by his twin brother. Harry shakes his head in disbelief.]\n",
      "Harry: Excuse me! C-could you tell me how to...?\n",
      "Mrs. Weasley: How to get on the platform? Yes, not to worry, dear. It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as well. [pan to a red haired boy, called Ron, who smiles] Now, all you've got to do is walk straight at the wall between platforms 9 and 10. Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous.\n",

      "Ron: Whoa!\n",
      "Harry: Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans?\n",
      "Ron: They mean every flavour! There's chocolate and peppermint, and there's also spinach, liver and tripe. George sweared he got a bogey-flavoured one once!\n",
      "Harry: [picks up a blue and gold package] These aren't real frogs, are they?\n",
      "Ron: It's just a spell. Besides, it's the cards you want. Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard. I got about 500 meself. [Harry opens the package, and a chocolate frog jumps onto the window and climbs up.] Watch it! [The frog reaches the open gap in the window and jumps out.] Oh, that's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them to begin with.\n",
      "Harry: [seeing Dumbledore's image in the card] I've got Dumbledore!\n",

      "Ron: Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you? [Scabbers squeaks] This is Scabbers, by the way. Pathetic, isn't he?\n",
      "Harry: Just a little bit.\n",

      "Hermione: Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? Of course, I've only tried a few simple ones myself, but they've all worked for me. For example... [Hermione goes over and sits across from Harry. He points her wand at his glasses and Harry tenses] Oculus Reparo. [The tape on the noseband vanishes, repairing his glasses as if they were good as new. Harry takes them off, amazed.] That's better, isn't it? Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter! I'm Hermione Granger. And you are...?\n",
      "Ron: [with his mouth full] I'm Ron Weasley.\n",
      "Hermione: Pleasure. You two better change into your robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon. [Gets up and leaves, then comes back and looks at Ron.] You've got dirt on your nose, by the way. Did you know? Just there. [Points to the dirt mark on Ron's nose. Ron scratches his nose, embarrassed.]\n",

They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Now while you're here, your house will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you points. Any rule breaking, and you will lose points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup.\n",

[Ron snickers at his name] Think my name's funny, do you? I've no need to ask yours. Red hair, and a hand-me-down robe? You must be a Weasley. You'll soon find that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there. [extends his hand to Harry.]\n",

      "Dumbledore: I have a few start-of-term notices I wish to announce. The first years, please note that the Dark Forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch, [shows a ragged old man, called Mr. Argus Filch, with his cat with red eyes, called Mrs. Norris.] has asked me to remind you that the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. Thank you. [He sits back down]\n",

      "McGonagall: Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't need one to find your seats.\n",
      "Snape: There will be no foolish wand-waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion-making. However, for those select few... [looks at Draco, who smiles] ...who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory and even put a stopper... [Draco looks on] ...in death. [Draco raises his eyebrows. Snape sees Harry, writing what Snape said in his lecture down, in, his view, not paying attention.] Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confident enough... to not... pay... attention. [Hermione nudges Harry, finally making him look up to the Professor. Snape then walks to where he can speak to Harry more properly.] Mr. Potter. Our... new... celebrity. Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood? [Hermione raises her hand. Harry shrugs.] You don't know? Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar? [Hermione's hand raises again.]\n",

To Hermione, who has still got her hand up.] Put your hand down, you silly girl. [He sits in front of Harry, and leans towards him.] For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. [everything is quiet] Well? [to the students] Why aren't you all copying this down? [The students obey Snape and start to write down what Snape said. Snape returns to his desk, and dips his quill into some ink.] And Gryffindors, note that five points will be taken from your house... for your classmate's cheek.

      "Hermione: That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed. Or worse, expelled. [turns and leaves, shutting the door to her dormitory.]\n",
      "Ron: She needs to sort out her priorities.\n",
      "Facts and Feathers\n",
      "Oliver: Quidditch is easy enough to understand. Each time has seven players. Three Chasers, two Beaters, one Keeper and a Seeker. That's you. There are three kinds of balls. [picks up a red one] This one's called the Quaffle. Now, the chasers handle the Quaffle and try to put it through one of those three hoops. [Points to the hoops in the Quidditch pitch in the distance.] The keeper, that's me, defends the hoops. [throws ball to Harry.] With me so far?\n",
      "Harry: [throws back] I think so. What are those? [points to two squirming chained down balls.]\n",
      "Oliver: You better take this. [hands Harry a small bat. He bends down and releases one ball. With an angry growl, it flies off into the air. The two boys watch it.] Careful now, it's coming back. [The balls comes whizzing down, and Harry cracks at it with the bat. The ball soars off through a statue, surprisingly without damaging it.] Not bad, Potter. You'd make a fair Beater. Uh-oh. [The ball zooms down, and Oliver grabs it, wriggling to get it back in the box. He succeeds and is out of breath.]\n",
      "Harry: What was that?!\n",
      "Oliver: Bludger. Nasty little buggers. But you are a Seeker. And the only thing I want you to worry about is this. The Golden Snitch. [hands Harry a walnut sized golden ball.]\n",
      "Harry: I like this ball.\n",
      "Oliver: Ah, you like it now. Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see.\n",
      "Harry: What do I do with it?\n",
      "Oliver: You catch it. Before the other team's Seeker. You catch this, the game is over. You catch this, Potter, and we win.\n",
      "Harry: Whoa!\n",
      "Flitwick: One of a wizard's most rudimentary skills is levitation, or the ability to make objects fly. Uh, do you have your feathers? [Hermione raises hers.] Good. Now, uh, don't forget the nice wrist movement we've been practising. Hmm? The swish and flick. Everyone.\n",
      "All (including Flitwick): The swish and flick.\n",
      "Flitwick: Good. Oh, and enunciate. Wingardium Leviosa. Off you go, then.\n",
      "Draco: Wingardium Levio-saaa.\n",
      "All: Wingardium Leviosa.\n",
      "Ron: Wingardrium Leviosar! [He waves his wand really fast numerous times because he thinks the spell didn't work. Hermione stops him.]\n",
      "Hermione: No, stop, stop, stop! You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, you're saying it wrong. It's Levi-o-sa, not Leviosar.\n",
      "Ron: You do it, then, if you're so clever. Go on, go on.\n",
      "Hermione: Wingardium Leviosa. [The feather glows and lifts up.]\n",
      "Flitwick: Oh, well done! See here, everyone, Miss Granger's done it! Oh, splendid!\n",
      "Seamus: Wingard Leviosa. Wingar-\n",
      "Flitwick: Well done, dear.\n",
      "Flitwick: Whooaaa! Ooh.\n",
      "Harry: I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor.\n",

      "Harry: I think she heard you.\n",
      "The Mountain Troll\n",
      "Harry: Where's Hermione?\n",
      "Neville: Parvati Patil said that she wouldn't come out of the girl's bathroom. She said that she'd been in there all afternoon, crying.\n",
      "Quirrell: TROLL! IN THE DUNGEON! T-TROOLLL IN THE DUNGEON! [Dumbledore rises from his seat in concern. Everyone looks at Quirrell and he stops and there is utter silence.] Thought you ought to know.\n",
      "Dumbledore: SILLLLLEEENNNNCEEEEE! [Everyone stops and calms down.] Everyone will please not panic! Now, prefects will lead their house back to the dormitories. Teachers will follow me to the dungeons.\n",
      "Girl: Hufflepuff, this way!\n",
      "Boy: Stay together!\n",
      "Percy: Gryffindors, keep up, please, and stay alert!\n",
      "Harry: How could a troll get in?\n",
      "Ron: Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid. Probably people playing jokes. [Suddenly, Harry stops and pulls Ron aside.] What?\n",
      "Harry: Hermione! She doesn't know!\n",
      "Ron: I think the troll's left the dungeon!\n",
      "Harry: It's going into the girl's bathroom!\n",
      "Harry: Hermione, move!\n",
      "Hermione: Help! Help! [The boys start throwing wood pieces at the troll.]\n",
      "Ron: Hey, pea brain! [Ron throws wood and hits the troll on the head. Hermione escapes from the stalls to under a sink, but the troll sees her and then comes over to smash her. It cracks the sink and barely misses Hermione. Harry cringes.]\n",
      "Hermione: (screams) Help!\n",
      "Harry: Whoa! [He lands on the troll's shoulders and is hurled around back and forth.]\n",
      "Ron: Ew!\n",
      "Harry: Whoa, whoa-whoa!\n",
      "Harry: Do something!\n",
      "Ron: What?\n",
      "Harry: Anything! [the troll swipes at Harry again] Hurry up!\n",
      "Hermione: Swish and flick!\n",
      "Ron: [correctly punctuating the words] Wingardium Leviosa! [Flick! The troll's club is lifted out of one of his hands and hovers above its head. The troll looks at his hand and opens it, then looks up, confused, just as the club comes crashing back down.] Cool. [It hits the troll's head that hard and the troll wavers, then drops Harry, who crawls away, and slowly comes crashing down, knocked out. Hermione approaches carefully.]\n",
      "Hermione: Is it dead?\n",
      "Harry: I don't think so. Just knocked out. [He grabs his wand which is covered in mucus.] Ugh! Troll bogies.\n",
      "McGonagall: Oh! Oh, my goodness! Explain yourselves, both of you!\n",
      "Ron and Harry: Well, what it is...\n",
      "Hermione: It's my fault, Professor McGonagall. [The teachers, Ron and Harry look at her.]\n",
      "McGonagall: Miss Granger?\n",
      "Hermione: I went looking for the troll. I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me, I'd probably be dead.\n",
      "McGonagall: Be that as it may, it was an extremely foolish thing to do. [Harry notices Snape's leg, which has the trousers' leg torn and a large cut on it. Snape notices and covers it up, glaring at Harry.] I would've expected more rational behavior on your part and am very disappointed in you, Miss Granger. Five points will be taken from Gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment. [she turns to Harry and Ron] As for you two gentlemen, I just hope you realize how fortunate you are. Not many first-year students could take on a fully grown mountain troll and live to tell the tale. Five points will be awarded to each of you... [Harry and Ron grin at each other] ...for sheer dumb luck.\n",
      "Quirrell: Perhaps you ought to go. It m-might wake up. Heh. [Harry, Ron and Hermione exit the bathroom. Quirrell looks at the unconscious troll. The troll growls, seemingly going to wake up.] Ahh! Hehe....\n",
      "(Extended Scene)\n",
      "Harry: [to Hermione] Good for you to get us out of trouble like that.\n",
      "Ron: Mind you, I mean, we did save her life.\n",
      "Harry: Mind you, she didn't need saving if you hadn't insulted her.\n",
      "Ron: What are friends for?\n",
      "Quidditch\n",
      "Ron: Take a bit of toast, mate, go on.\n",
      "Hermione: Ron's right, Harry. You're gonna need your strength today.\n",
      "Harry: I'm not hungry.\n",
      "Snape: Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you. Even if it is against Slytherin. [Snape walks off, limping. Harry notices this.]\n",
      "Harry: That explains the blood.\n",
      "Hermione: Blood?\n",
      "Harry: Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. But, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping.\n",
      "Hermione: But why would anyone go near that dog?\n",
      "Harry: The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. He said it was Hogwarts' business, very secret.\n",
      "Hermione: So you're saying...\n",
      "Harry: That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants.\n",
      "Hermione: Bit early for mail, isn't it?\n",
      "Harry: But I... I never get mail.\n",
      "Ron: Let's open it.\n",
      "Harry: It's a broomstick!\n",
      "Ron: Thats not just any broomstick, Harry. [recognizing the model] It's a Nimbus 2000!\n",
      "Harry: But who...?\n",
      "Oliver: Scared, Harry?\n",
      "Harry: A little.\n",
      "Oliver: That's all right. I felt the same way before my first game.\n",
      "Harry: What happened?\n",
      "Oliver: Er, I don't really remember. I took a Bludger to the head two minutes in. Woke up in the hospital a week later.\n",
      "Lee: Hello! And welcome to Hogwarts' first Quidditch game of the season! Today's game, Slytherin vs. Gryffindor!\n",
      "Neville: Gryffindor!\n",
      "Lee: The players take their positions as Madam Hooch steps out onto the field to begin the game!\n",
      "Hooch: Now, I want a nice, clean game from all of you! [looks at Slytherin. She kicks the trunk, and the Bludgers zoom out.]\n",
      "Lee: The Bludgers are up, followed by the Golden Snitch. Remember, the Snitch is worth 150 points. The Seeker who catches the Snitch ends the game.\n",
      "Lee: The Quaffle is released and the game begins!\n",
      "Lee: Angelina Johnson scores! 10 points for Gryffindor! [He presses a button and a 10 shows up beside a plaque with Gryffindor's name.]\n",
      "Harry: Yes! [A Bludger suddenly zooms by him.] Whoa!\n",
      "Hagrid: Well done!\n",
      "Lee: Slytherin takes possession of the Quaffle. Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.\n",
      "Ron and Seamus: Yay!\n",
      "Harry: Yes!\n",
      "Lee: Another 10 points to Gryffindor! [he adds another 10 to the score with a ding.]\n",
      "Gryffindors: Yay!\n",
      "Flint: Give me that! [he grabs a beaters bat from one and whacks a Bludger right at Oliver. It hits Oliver directly in the stomach and he plummets to the ground, knocked out.]\n",
      "Flint: [to his teammates] Take that side!\n",
      "Interference Overcome\n",
      "Harry: Whoa! Whooa!\n",
      "Hagrid: What's going on with Harry's broomstick?\n",
      "Hermione: It's Snape! He's jinxing the broom!\n",
      "Ron: Jinxing the broom? What do we do?\n",
      "Hermione: Leave it to me. [She hands Ron her binoculars and leaves the stands.]\n",
      "Ron: [concerned] Come on, Hermione!\n",
      "Hermione: [quietly] Lacarnum Inflamarae.\n",
      "Man: Fire! You're on fire!\n",
      "Snape: What? Oh! [knocks the man back, who falls into Quirrell, who then also falls. Snape bats out the fire and acts as though nothing happened. The broom stops bucking, and Harry climbs back on. The Slytherin seeker is after the Snitch. Harry takes off.]\n",
      "Ron: Go!\n",
      "Hagrid: Go, go, go!\n",
      "Hagrid: Looks like he's gonna be sick!\n",
      "Lee: He's got the Snitch! Harry Potter receives 150 points for catching the Snitch!\n",

      "Draco: [dismayed] No!\n",

      "Christmas Gift\n",
      "Hagrid: Nonsense! Why would Snape put a curse on Harry's broom?\n",
      "Harry: Who knows? Why was he trying to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween?\n",
      "Hagrid: [turns to them, suspiciously] Who told you about Fluffy?\n",
      "Ron: Fluffy?\n",
      "Hermione: That thing has a name?\n",
      "Hagrid: Well, of course he's got a name. He's mine. I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. Then I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the...\n",
      "Harry: Yes?\n",
      "Hagrid: Shouldn't have said that. No more questions! Don't ask any more questions. That's top secret, that is.\n",
      "Harry: But, Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it.\n",
      "Hagrid: Codswallop. Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher.\n",
      "Hermione: Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a spell when I see one. I've read all about them. You've got to keep eye contact and Snape wasn't blinking.\n",
      "Harry: Exactly.\n",
      "Hagrid: [Sighs] Now, you listen to me, all three of yeh. Yer meddling in things that ought not to be meddled in. It's dangerous. What that dog is guarding is strictly between Professor Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.\n",
      "Harry: [Curious and turns to Ron then back to Hagrid] Nicholas Flamel?\n",
      "Hagrid: [Mumbles to himself] I shouldn't have said that. I should not have said that.\n",
      "Harry: Nicholas Flamel. [Turns to Hermione] Who's Nicholas Flamel?\n",
      "Hermione: I don't know. [Shakes her head]\n",
      "Ghosts: Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Ring the Hogwart bell. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas...\n",
      "Harry: Knight to E5. [The Knight moves to its destination. Hermione walks up behind Harry.]\n",
      "Ron: [With a smug face] Queen to E5.\n",
      "Hermione: [With a shocked face] That's totally barbaric!\n",
      "Ron: That's wizard's chess. [Looks over to Hermione] I see you've packed.\n",
      "Hermione: I see you haven't.\n",
      "Ron: Change of plans, my parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother, Charlie. He's studying dragons there.\n",
      "Hermione: Good. You can help Harry, then. He's going to go and look in the library for information on Nicholas Flamel.\n",
      "Ron: We've looked a hundred times!\n",
      "Hermione: [Leans over on the table closer to Ron and Harry] Not in the restricted section. Happy Christmas. [Hermione leaves Ron and Harry]\n",
      "Ron: [Looks at Harry] I think we've had a bad influence on her.\n",
      "Ron: [From downstairs] Harry, wake up! Come on, Harry, wake up!\n",
      "Ron: [Looking up at Harry] Happy Christmas, Harry.\n",
      "Harry: Happy Christmas, Ron. [Harry notices Ron's sweater] What are you wearing?\n",
      "Ron: [Looks down at sweater] Oh. My mum made it. [Looking back up at Harry] It looks like you've got one too.\n",
      "Harry: I-I've got presents?\n",
      "Ron: [Nodding] Yeah!\n",
      "Ron: There they are.\n",
      "Harry: \"Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well.\" [Harry looks over to Ron, who shrugs his shoulders]\n",
      "Ron: What is it?\n",
      "Harry: [Looking down at the object] It's some kind of cloak.\n",
      "Ron: Well, let's see, then. Put it on.\n",
      "Ron: Whoa!\n",
      "Harry: [Looks down at his invisible body] My body's gone!\n",
      "Ron: I know what that is. That's an invisibility cloak!\n",
      "Harry: I'm invisible? [Harry spins around, looking down at himself]\n",
      "Ron: They're really rare. [Ron looks down at the note] I wonder who gave it to you.\n",
      "Harry: [Now also looking down at the note] There was no name. It just said, \"Use it well.\"\n",
      "Cloaked In Darkness\n",
      "Harry: Famous fire eaters. 15th-Century Fiends. Flamel. Nicholas Flamel. Where are you?\n",
      "Filch: Who's there?! [Harry whips around and quickly grabs his cloak, causing the lamp to fall and shatter.] I know you're in there. You can't hide. [Harry puts on his cloak and creeps around Filch.] Who is it? Show yourself!\n",
      "Quirrell: Severus... I-I thought...\n",
      "Snape: You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell.\n",
      "Quirrell: I don't know w-what you m-mean.\n",
      "Snape: You know perfectly well what I mean. [Snape senses something who causes Harry to stop breathing. Snape reaches out to grab something but doesn't. He whips his finger back in front of Quirrell's face.] We'll have another chat soon. When you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie.\n",
      "Filch: Oh, Professors. I found this in the Restricted Section. It's still hot. That means there's a student out of bed.\n",
      "The Mirror of Erised\n",
      "Harry: Mum? [Lily nods and smiles] Dad? [James nods and smiles. Harry reaches out to touch them but only gets the mirror. Then, his mother puts her hand on his shoulder. He puts his own hand on his own shoulders, as if trying to feel her there.]\n",
      "Harry: Ron, you've really got to see this! Ron, you've got to see this! [pulls back covers. Ron wakes up.] Ron, Ron, come on, get out of bed!\n",
      "Ron: [tired] Why?\n",
      "Harry: There's something you've got to see. Now, come on!\n",

      "Harry: [moves over] Look in properly. Go on, stand there. There. You see them, don't you? That's my dad.\n",
      "Ron: That's me! Only I'm head boy. And I'm holding the Quidditch cup. And bloody hell! I'm Quidditch Captain too! I look good. Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?\n",

      "Dumbledore: Back again, Harry? [Harry turns around and stands up.] I see that you, like so many before you have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I trust by now you realize what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is.\n",
      "Harry: So then, it shows us what we want. Whatever we want.\n",
      "Dumbledore: [whilst looking at the mirror] Yes. And no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, Harry, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it. Even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home. And I must ask you not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live.

      "Hagrid: I won it. Off a stranger I met down at a pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid of it, as a matter of fact.\n",
      "Hermione: Is that... a dragon?\n",
      "Ron: That's not just a dragon. That's a Norwegian Ridgeback. My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.\n",
      "Hagrid: Isn't he beautiful? Oh, bless him. Look, he knows his mummy. Hehehe. Hallo, Norbert.\n",
      "Harry: Norbert?\n",
      "Hagrid: Yeah, well, he's gotta have a name, don't he? [Ron laughs] Don't you, Norbert? [he raises fingers back and forth across Norbert's chin] Dededede.\n",
      "Hagrid: Ohh! [he quickly pats out the smolders in his beard] Oooh, ooh, ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo! Ooh, well... he'll have to be trained up a bit, of course. Heh. [Norbert hiccups. Hagrid sees someone looking in the window.] Who's that? [It turns out to be Draco Malfoy, who scampers away.]\n",
      "Harry: Malfoy.\n",
      "Hagrid: Oh, dear.\n",
      "Harry: Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I ever met him.\n",
      "Ron: It's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows.\n",
      "Harry: I don't understand. Is that bad?\n",
      "Ron: It's bad.\n",
      "McGonagall: Good evening.\n",
      "McGonagall: [sternly] Nothing, I repeat, nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night. Therefore, as punishment for your actions, 50 points will be taken.\n",
      "Harry: 50?!\n",
      "McGonagall: Each. [Harry gasps] And to ensure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention.\n",
      "Draco: Excuse me, Professor, perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said the four of us.\n",
      "McGonagall: No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy. You see, honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours. You will join your classmates in detention.\n",
      "The Forbidden Forest\n",
      "Filch: A pity they let the old punishments die. There was a time detention would find you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons. God, I miss the screaming. [Draco gulps, and Hermione rushes by.] You'll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight. He's got a little job to do inside the Dark Forest. [Hagrid appears with a crossbow. He sniffles.] A sorry lot, this, Hagrid. Oh, good God, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?\n",
      "Hagrid: [sniffs and sighs] Norbert's gone. Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony.\n",
      "Hermione: Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind.\n",
      "Hagrid: Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania? [Filch rolls eyes.] What if the other dragons are mean to him? He's only a baby, after all.\n",
      "Filch: Oh, for God's sake, pull yourself together, man. You're going into the Forest, after all. Got to have your wits about you.\n",
      "Draco: The Forest? I thought that was a joke! We can't go in there. Students aren't allowed. And there are... [a howl sounds] ...werewolves!\n",
      "Filch: There's more than werewolves in those trees, lad. You can be sure of that. [Draco looks frightened.] Nighty-night. [He leaves to go back into the castle]\n",
      "Hagrid: Right. Let's go.\n",
      "Harry: Hagrid, what is that?\n",
      "Hagrid: What we're here for. See that? That's unicorn's blood, that is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one's been hurt bad by something. [Harry suddenly sees a large, cloaked figure walking through the trees. He looks at Hagrid.] So, it's our job to go and find the poor beast. Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me.\n",
      "Ron: Okay.\n",
      "Hagrid: And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy. [Draco grimaces, and Harry nods.]\n",
      "Draco: Okay. Then I get Fang.\n",
      "Hagrid: Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward. [Fang whines.]\n",
      "Draco: You wait till my father hears about this. This is servant's stuff.\n",
      "Harry: If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared.\n",
      "Draco: Scared, Potter? [He scoffs, but suddenly hears a howl] Did you hear that? Come on, Fang. Scared!\n",
      "Harry: What is it, Fang?\n",
      "Draco: HELP!!!!!\n",
      "Firenze: Harry Potter, you must leave. You are known to many creatures here. The Forest is not safe at this time. Especially for you.\n",
      "Harry: But what was that thing you saved me from?\n",
      "Firenze: A monstrous creature. It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. But at a terrible price. You have slain something so pure that from the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. A cursed life.\n",
      "Harry: But who would choose such a life?\n",
      "Firenze: Can you think of no one?\n",
      "Harry: Do you mean to say that thing that killed the unicorn that was drinking its blood, that was Voldemort?\n",
      "Firenze: Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment, Mr. Potter?\n",
      "Harry: [realizing] The Philosopher's Stone.\n",
      "Hermione: Harry!\n",
      "Hagrid: Hello there, Firenze. I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. You all right there, Harry? [Harry nods]\n",
      "Firenze: Harry Potter, this is where I leave you. You're safe now. Good luck.\n",
      "Up to Something\n",
      "Hermione: [she, Harry, and Ron are meeting in the common room] You mean You-Know-Who's out there right now in the Forest?\n",
      "Harry: But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong. Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself. He wants the Stone for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He'll... he'll come back.\n",
      "Ron: But if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to kill you, do you?\n",
      "Harry: I think if he'd had the chance, he might have tried to kill me tonight.\n",
      "Ron: [gulps] And to think, I've been worrying about my Potions final.\n",
      "Hermione: Hang on a minute. [Harry and Ron both glance at her] We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared? Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore is around, Harry, you're safe. As long as Dumbledore is around, you can't be touched. [gives him a reassuring smile; he nods]\n",
      "Hermione: I'd always heard Hogwarts' end-of-the-year exams were frightful, but I've found that rather enjoyable.\n",
      "Ron: Speak for yourself. All right there, Harry?\n",
      "Harry: My scar. It keeps burning.\n",
      "Hermione: It's happened before.\n",
      "Harry: Not like this.\n",
      "Ron: Perhaps you should see the nurse.\n",
      "Harry: I think it's a warning. It means danger's coming. [A look of realization] Ah. Oh! Of course!\n",
      "Hermione: What is it?\n",
      "Harry: Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have one? I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pocket? Why didn't I see it before?\n",
      "Harry: Hagrid, [Hagrid stops playing] who gave you the dragon egg? What did he look like?\n",
      "Hagrid: I dunno. I never saw his face. He kept his hood up.\n",
      "Harry: This stranger, though, you and he must have talked.\n",
      "Hagrid: Well, he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. I told 'im. I said, \"After Fluffy, a dragon's gonna be no problem.\"\n",
      "Harry: Did he seem interested in Fluffy?\n",
      "Hagrid: Well, o' course he was interested in Fluffy. How often do yeh come across a three-headed dog, even if yer in the trade? But I told 'im. I said... I said, \"The trick with any beast is to know how to calm 'im. Take Fluffy, for example. Jus' play him a bit o' music and he falls straight to sleep.\" I shouldn't have told you that. [The Trio runs off] Where're you goin'? Wait?\n",
      "Harry: We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!\n",
      "McGonagall: I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here. He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London.\n",
      "Harry: He’s gone? Now? But this is important! This is about the Philosopher's Stone!\n",
      "McGonagall: [Looking shocked] How do you know...?\n",
      "Harry: Someone's going to try to steal it!\n",
      "McGonagall: I don't know how you three found out about the Stone, but I assure you it is perfectly well protected. Now would you go back to your dormitories? Quietly.\n",
      "Harry: That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape. Which means he knows how to get past Fluffy.\n",
      "Hermione: And with Dumbledore gone...\n",
      "Snape: Good afternoon. Now, what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this?\n",
      "Hermione: Uh, w-w-w... we-we were just-\n",
      "Snape: You ought to be careful. People will think you're... up to something. [Walks away]\n",
      "Hermione: Now what do we do?\n",
      "Harry: [With a determined look] We go down the trapdoor. Tonight.\n",
      "Through the Trapdoor\n",
      "Harry: Trevor.\n",
      "Ron: Trevor, shh, go! You shouldn't be here!\n",
      "Neville: [appears behind a chair] Neither should you. You're sneaking out again, aren't you?\n",
      "Harry: Now, Neville, listen. We were-\n",
      "Neville: No! I won't let you! [stands] You'll get Gryffindor into trouble again! I-I'll fight you. [Neville holds out his fists.]\n",
      "Hermione: Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this.[takes out wand] Petrificus Totalus.\n",
      "Ron: [Gulp] You're a little scary sometimes, you know that? Brilliant, but scary.\n",
      "Harry: Let's go. [Walks by Neville] Sorry.\n",
      "Hermione: Sorry.\n",
      "Ron: It's for your own good, you know.\n",
      "Hermione: Ow! You stood on my foot!\n",
      "Ron: Sorry. [A flame lights up. Hermione draws out her wand and points it at the door.]\n",
      "Hermione: Alohomora.\n",
      "Ron: Wait a minute. He's....\n",
      "Ron: Snoring.\n",
      "Harry: Snape's already been here. He's put a spell on the harp.\n",
      "Ron: Ugh! It's got horrible breath.\n",
      "Harry: We have to move its paw.\n",
      "Ron: What?!\n",
      "Harry: Come on! [grabs paw, which is blocking the door.] Okay. Push! [They strain and move it. They open the door.] I'll go first. Don't follow until I give you a sign. [Fluffy's eyes open.] If something bad happens, get yourselves out. Does it seem a bit quiet to you?\n",
      "Hermione: The harp. It stopped playing.\n",
      "Ron: Ew! Yuck! Ugh. [All three kids look up and see Fluffy standing there. Fluffy barks and growls, thrashing. It breaks the harp and dives at the three.]\n",
      "Harry: Jump! Go! [They all jump through the trapdoor.]\n",
      "Ron: Ahh! [gasps as he lands on some mushy black ropelike vines.] Whoa. Lucky this plant-thing's here, really.\n",
      "Harry: Whoa! [The plant begins to move towards them.] Oh. Ahh! [The plant ties both of them up like a rope.]\n",
      "Hermione: Stop moving, both of you. This is Devil's Snare. You have to relax. If you don't, it will only kill you faster.\n",
      "Ron: Kill us faster?! Oh, now I can relax!\n",
      "Ron/Harry: Hermione!\n",
      "Ron: Now what are we gonna do?!\n",
      "Hermione: Just relax!\n",
      "Harry: Hermione, where are you?\n",
      "Hermione: [from below] Do what I say! Trust me.\n",
      "Ron: Ahh! Harry!\n",
      "Ron: Harry!\n",
      "Hermione: Are you okay?\n",
      "Harry: Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.\n",
      "Ron: Help!\n",
      "Hermione: He's not relaxing, is he?\n",
      "Harry: Apparently not.\n",
      "Ron: Help! Help me!\n",
      "Hermione: We've gotta do something!\n",
      "Harry: What?\n",
      "Hermione: Uh! I remember reading something in Herbology.\n",
      "Ron: Help!\n",
      "Hermione: Um, Devil's Snare, Devil's Scare, [The snare shuts Ron's mouth] it's deadly fun... but will sulk in the sun! That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight! [takes out wand and points upwards.] Lumus Solem! [A beam of light shoots out. The Snare shrieks and recoils. Ron falls below.]\n",
      "Ron: Ahhh!\n",
      "Harry: Ron, are you okay?\n",
      "Ron: Yeah.\n",
      "Harry: Okay.\n",
      "Ron: [stands] Whew! Lucky we didn't panic.\n",
      "Harry: Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.\n",
      "Hermione: What is that?\n",
      "Harry: I don't know. Sounds like wings.\n",
      "Hermione: Curious. I've never seen birds like these.\n",
      "Harry: They're not birds. They're keys. And I'll bet one of them fits that door. [They come upon a broomstick, suspended in the air.]\n",
      "Hermione: What's this all about?\n",
      "Harry: I don't know. Strange.\n",
      "Ron: [rattles lock.] Alohomora! [Shrugs] Well, it was worth a try.\n",
      "Hermione: Ugh! What're we going to do? There must be a thousand keys up there!\n",
      "Ron: We're looking for a big old fashioned one. Probably rusty like the handle.\n",
      "Harry: There! I see it! [points] The one with the broken wing. [He looks at the broom.]\n",
      "Hermione: What's wrong, Harry?\n",
      "Harry: It's too simple.\n",
      "Ron: Oh, go on, Harry! If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can! You're the youngest Seeker in a century!\n",
      "Ron: This complicates things a bit.\n",
      "Harry: Catch the key!\n",
      "Ron: Hurry up!\n",
      "Wizard's Chess\n",
      "Hermione: I don't like this. I don't like this at all.\n",
      "Harry: Where are we? A graveyard?\n",
      "Ron: This is no graveyard. [sighs] It's a chessboard. [Walks out onto the marble board and flames light, illuminating the board and GIANT players. Harry and Hermione come up with him.]\n",
      "Harry: There's the door.\n",
      "Hermione: Now what do we do?\n",
      "Ron: It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room. Alright. Harry, you take the empty Bishop's square. Hermione, you'll be the Queen-side castle. As for me, I'll be a knight. [They all take their places.]\n",
      "Hermione: What happens now?\n",
      "Ron: [aboard a horse.] Well, white moves first. And then... we play. [A pawn on the other side moves forward. Ron studies the game.]\n",
      "Hermione: Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like... real wizard's chess, do you?\n",
      "Ron: You there, D5. [A black pawn moves forward, diagonal to the white pawn. The white pawn raises its swords and smashes the black one. The three jump.] Yes, Hermione. I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess.\n",
      "Ron: Castle to E4! [Smash!]\n",
      "Ron: Pawn to C3! [Smash! Boom! The Queen turns and smashes a piece! Harry, Ron, and Hermione wince.]\n",
      "Sacrifice Play\n",
      "Harry: Wait a minute.\n",
      "Ron: You understand right, Harry. Once I make my move, the Queen will take me. Then you're free to check the King.\n",
      "Harry: No. Ron, no!\n",
      "Hermione: What is it?\n",
      "Harry: He's going to sacrifice himself!\n",
      "Hermione: No, Ron, you can't! [Ron closes his eyes.] There must be another way!\n",
      "Ron: [turns to face Hermione.] Do you want to stop Snape from getting that Stone or not? Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it. Not me. Not Hermione. You! [Harry nods.] Knight to H3.\n",
      "Ron: Check.\n",
      "Ron: Ahhhh!\n",
      "Harry: RON! [Hermione starts walking to him.] No, don't move! Don't forget, we're still playing. [Hermione moves back. Harry walks the diagonal in front of the King.] Checkmate. [The King's sword falls onto the ground in victory. Harry breathes out and then the two run to Ron. They bend beside him.] Take care of Ron. Then go to the owlery. Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right. I have to go on.\n",
      "Hermione: You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great wizard. You really are.\n",
      "Harry: Not as good as you.\n",
      "Hermione: [smile] Me? Books and cleverness? There are more important things. Friendship, and bravery. And Harry, just be careful.\n",
      "The Man With Two Faces\n",
      "Harry: You? [Quirrell turns to face him] No, i-it can't be. Snape, h-he was the one—\n",
      "Quirrell: Yes, he does seem the type, doesn't he? Next to him, who would suspect p-p-p-poor, st-stuttering Professor Quirrell?\n",
      "Harry: But-but that day, during the Quidditch match, Snape tried to kill me.\n",
      "Quirrell: [smiling evilly] No, dear boy. I tried to kill you! [Harry eyes him in disbelief and confusion] And trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would have succeeded. Even with Snape muttering his little countercurse.\n",
      "Harry: Snape was trying to save me?\n",
      "Quirrell: I knew you were a danger to me right from the off. Especially after Halloween.\n",
      "Harry: Then-then you let the troll in!\n",
      "Quirrell: Very good, Potter, yes. Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled. While everyone else was running about the dungeon, he went to the third floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again. [he turns towards the mirror again; Harry winces as his scar burns again] He rarely left me alone. But he doesn't understand. I'm never alone. Never. [staring into the mirror] Now, what does this mirror do? I see what I desire. I see myself holding the Stone. But how do I get it?\n",
      "Unseen Inhuman Voice: Use the boy. [Harry looks around, wondering where the voice is coming from]\n",
      "Quirrell: [turns to Harry] Come here, Potter! Now! [Harry slowly walks down the stairs, towards Quirrell and the mirror] Tell me, what do you see? [Harry looks into the mirror, and for a few seconds, sees him standing next to Quirrell, then his reflection reaches into its pocket and pulls out a gleaming red ruby, the Philosopher’s Stone; Harry stares in amazement as his reflection smiles and winks, then puts the stone back in its pocket; Harry feels his pocket and realizes the Stone really is in his pocket, then looks up again] What is it? [glances at Harry while speaking] What do you see?\n",
      "Harry: [looks at Quirrell, then back at the mirror, determined not to let Quirrell know that he has the Stone] I-I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore. I've won the House Cup.\n",
      "Unseen Inhuman Voice: He lies.\n",
      "Quirrell: [angrily shouting] Tell the truth! What do you see?\n",
      "Unseen Inhuman Voice: Let me speak to him.\n",
      "Quirrell: [as Harry backs away] Master, you are not strong enough.\n",
      "Unseen Inhuman Voice: I have strength enough for this.\n",
      "Voldemort: Harry Potter, we meet again.\n",
      "Harry: [realizing his identity] Voldemort.\n",
      "Voldemort: Yes. You see what I've become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another. A mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can. Something that, conveniently enough, lies in your pocket. [Realizing Voldemort is referring to the Philosopher's Stone, Harry turns and runs back up the stairs.]\n",
      "Magic Touch\n",
      "Voldemort: Stop him! [Quirrell snaps his fingers, instantly causing fire walls to block all the exits, trapping Harry in the room] Don't be a fool. Why suffer a horrific death when you can join me and live?\n",
      "Harry: [shakes his head] Never!\n",
      "Voldemort: Haha. Bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry, would you like to see your mother and father again? Together, we can bring them back. [In the mirror, Harry's parents appear in the reflection.] All I ask for is something in return. [Harry takes the Stone from his pocket.] That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil. There is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do extraordinary things. Just give me the Stone! [James and Lily Potter fade from the reflection]\n",
      "Harry: You liar!\n",
      "Voldemort: Kill him!\n",
      "Quirrell: Ahh! Ahh! [He backs up away from Harry. His hand is crumbling into ash and dust.] What is this magic? [His hand disintegrates]\n",
      "Voldemort: Fool, get the Stone!\n",
      "Mark of Love\n",
      "Dumbledore: Good afternoon, Harry. Ah. Tokens from your admirers?\n",
      "Harry: Admirers?\n",
      "Dumbledore: What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret. So, naturally, the whole school knows. [They both smile.] Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs.\n",
      "Harry: Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione?\n",
      "Dumbledore: Fine. They're both just fine.\n",
      "Harry: But what happened to the Stone?\n",
      "Dumbledore: Relax, dear boy. The Stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around.\n",
      "Harry: But then, Flamel, he'll die, won't he?\n",
      "Dumbledore: [sits on the bed.] He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die.\n",
      "Harry: How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next...\n",
      "Dumbledore: Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me that is saying something.\n",
      "Harry: Does that mean, with the Stone gone, that is, that Voldemort can never come back?\n",
      "Dumbledore: Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him? [Harry shakes his head.] It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you. And that kind of act leaves a mark. [Harry touches his scar.] No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin.\n",
      "Harry: What is it?\n",
      "Dumbledore: Love, Harry. Love. [Pats Harry's head gently and stands up.] Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit-flavoured one. And since then, I'm afraid I've lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee. [takes brown bean and eats it.] Mm. Alas! Earwax.\n",
      "House Cup Winner\n",
      "Harry: All right there, Ron?\n",
      "Ron: All right. You?\n",
      "Harry: [as he shrugs] All right. Hermione?\n",
      "Hermione: [smiling] Never better.\n",
      "Dumbledore: Another year gone. And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarding. And the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor with 312 points. [There is a medium applause from the crowd.] Third place, Hufflepuff with 352 points. [The applause for Hufflepuff is slightly louder than the clapping for Gryffindor.] In second place, Ravenclaw with 426 points. [Applause again, this time with a slight cheer from some students.] And in first place, with 472 points, Slytherin house. [A loud roar rises from the Slytherin table, as students stand up and clap for themselves. Hermione scowls with her hand to her cheek; Snape applauds the students of his house]\n",
      "Draco: Nice one, mate. [sneers at Ron]\n",
      "Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin. Well done, Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account. And I have a few last-minute points to award. [Some faces at the Gryffindor table rise hopefully.] To Miss Hermione Granger, for the cool use of intellect while others were in grave peril, 50 points. [Hermione looks surprised, while the other Gryffindor students applaud her.]\n",
      "Harry: [giving Hermione a pat on the back] Good job. [Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle don't like what's happening. Hermione looks at Hagrid, who looks back to her with a proud smile.]\n",
      "Dumbledore: Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess that Hogwarts has seen these many years, 50 points. [Ron looks even more surprised than Hermione did and the Gryffindor table is applauding even louder.] And third, to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house 60 points.\n",
      "Hermione: We're tied with Slytherin!\n",
      "Dumbledore: And finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award 10 points to Neville Longbottom. [Neville can't believe what he just heard and the Gryffindors that heard Hermione's whisper are cheering the loudest. Malfoy looks quite uncertain now.] Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of decoration is in order. [He claps and motions his hands towards the Slytherin banners, where they flap heavily, until the banners have changed completely to red and gold with the Gryffindor symbol] Gryffindor wins the House Cup.\n",

      "Hagrid: Oh. Go on. On with you. On with you now. [Harry lets go] Oh, listen, Harry. If that dolt of a cousin of yours, Dudley, gives you any grief, you could always, um, threaten him with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail of his.\n",
      "Harry: But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that.\n",
      "Hagrid: I do. But your cousin don't, do he? Eh? [chuckle] Off you go.\n",

      "Awww, smile. [She takes a photograph of him. She gasps in joy.] Vernon, just look at him. I can't believe it. In just a week you'll be off to Smeltings.\n",

      "Ha!\n",

      "[after reading a postcard] Oh, Marge is ill! Ate a funny whelk.\n",

      "Fine day Sunday. In my opinion, best day of the week. Why is that, Dudley?\n",
      "[when Dudley shrugs and didn't answer, as Harry hands a cookie to Vernon] Because there's no post on Sunday?\n",
      "Ah, right you are, Harry. No post on Sunday. Ha! No blasted letters today. No, sir. Not one single bloody letter, not one. [Harry sees a shadow outside the window. Outside, millions of owls are perched.] No, sir, not one blasted, miserable-\n",
      "AHH! Make it stop! Please make it stop! [He jumps on Petunia's lap as she and Vernon continue screaming] What is it? Please tell me what's happening!\n",
      "Go away! Ahh! Give me that! Give me that letter!\n",

      "[to himself] Make a wish, Harry. [he blows the \"candles\" on the drawn birthday cake]\n",
      "Who's there?! Ahh!\n",
      "Sorry about that. [He puts the door back up]\n",
      "[aiming his gun at him] I demand that you leave at once, sir! You are breaking and entering!\n",
      "Dry up, Dursley, you great prune. [The gun fires upwards, blasting a hole in the ceiling, causing the two to shriek in fear. Hagrid notices Dudley.] Mind, I haven't seen you since you was a baby, Harry. But yer a bit more along than I would have expected. Particularly 'round the middle.\n",
      "I-I-I'm not Harry.\n",
      "I-I am.\n",
      "Well, of course you are! Got somethin' for yeh. 'Fraid I might have sat on it at some point, but I imagine it'll taste fine just the same. Ahh.\n",
      "Baked it myself, words and all. Heh.\n",

      "Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts. O' course, yeh'll know all about Hogwarts.\n",
      "Sorry, no.\n",
      "No? Blimey, Harry, didn't you ever wonder where yer mum and dad learned it all?\n",
      "Learnt what?\n",
      "Yer a wizard, Harry.\n",
      "I-I'm a what?\n",
      "A wizard. And a thumping good one, I'd wager, once yer trained up little.\n",
      "No, you've made a mistake. I mean, I can't be... a-a wizard. I mean, I'm just... Harry. Just Harry.\n",
      "Well, Just Harry. Did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn't explain when you were angry or scared? [Harry softens his expression] Ah.\n",
      "\"Dear, Mr. Potter. We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\"\n",
      "[to Hagrid] He will not be going, I tell you! We swore when we took him in, we'd put a stop to all this rubbish!\n",
      "You knew? You knew all along and you never told me?\n",
      "Of course we knew. How could you not be? My perfect sister being who she was. Oh, my mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter. \"We have a witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful?\" I was the only one to see her for what she was. A freak! And then she met that Potter. And then she had you, and I knew you would be the same. Just as strange, just as... abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up! And we got landed with you.\n",
      "[to Petunia, angrily] Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash!\n",
      "A car crash? A car crash killed Lily and James Potter?!\n",
      "We had to say something.\n",
      "It's an outrage! It's a scandal!\n",
      "He'll not be going!\n",
      "Oh-ho-ho, and I suppose a great muggle like yerself's goin' to stop him, are yeh?\n",
      "Muggle?\n",
      "[to Harry, calmly] Non-magic folk. [he immediately draws his attention back to Vernon and Petunia in anger] This boy's had his name down ever since he were born! [As Hagrid was talking, Dudley was munching on Harry's cake.] He's going to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world, and he'll be under the finest headmaster that Hogwarts has ever seen\n",
      "I will not pay to have some crackpot old fool teach him magic tricks!\n",
      "NEVER – INSULT – ALBUS DUMBLEDORE – IN FRONT OF ME.\n",
      "Ahh!\n",
      "Oh, um, I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts about that. Strictly speaking, I'm not allowed to do magic.\n",
      "[Nods] Okay.\n",
      "[checks his pocket-watch] Ooh, we're a bit behind schedule. Bes' be off. [he goes off to the door and pulls it down again before stepping out. He turns to Harry] Unless you'd rather stay, of course. Hmm?\n",
      "[reading the list] First year students will require\n",
      "Essential bit of equipment, Harry.\n",
      "One pair of dragon-hide gloves. [he turns to Hagrid again] Hagrid, do they mean for a real dragon?\n",
      "Well, they don't mean a penguin, do they? Heh. Crikey, I'd love a dragon.\n",
      "You'd like a dragon?\n",
      "Vastly misunderstood beasts, Harry. Vastly misunderstood. [He suddenly eyes a woman and then he nods. The woman returns to reading her paper.]\n",
      "All students must be equipped with... one standard size 2 pewter cauldron and may bring, if they desire, either an owl, a cat, or a toad. Could we find all this in London?\n",
      "If you know where to go.\n",
      "Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?\n",
      "No thanks, Tom. I'm on official Hogwarts business today. Just helpin' young Harry here buy his school supplies.\n",
      "Bless my soul. It's Harry Potter!\n",
      "Welcome back, Mr. Potter. Welcome back.\n",
      "Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter. I can't believe I'm meeting you at last.\n",
      "Harry P-potter. C-can't tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.\n",
      "Hello, Professor. I didn't see you there. Harry, this is Professor Quirrell. He'll be yer Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts.\n",
      "Oh, nice to meet you. [puts out his hand, offering a handshake with Quirrell. But he looks at Harry's head and hesitatingly refuses]\n",
      "F-fearfully f-fascinating subject. N-not that you need it, e-eh, Potter? Heheh.\n",
      "Yes, well, mus' be goin' now. Lots to buy. Heh-heh-heh.\n",
      "Goodbye.\n",
      "See, Harry? You're famous!\n",
      "But why am I famous, Hagrid? All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?\n",
      "I'm not sure I'm exactly the right person to tell you that, Harry. [Taps the brick wall clockwise with his umbrella. The blocks then magically shift and open up to reveal a hidden, busy street called Diagon Alley.] Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley. [Harry grins broadly as they step into the street and walk down it. An owl screeches.] Here's where yeh'll get yer quills and yer ink, and over there all yer bits and bobs fer doing yer wizardry.\n",
      "It's a world class racing broom.\n",
      "Wow! Look at it! The new Nimbus 2000!\n",
      "It's the fastest model yet. [the camera pans to see the broom's model name on the handle]\n",
      "But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this? I haven't any money.\n",
      "Well, there's yer money, Harry. [he points to a tall, white, marble building, Gringotts Bank] Gringotts, the Wizard Bank. T'ain't no safer place, not one. 'Cept perhaps Hogwarts.\n",
      "Uh, Hagrid, what exactly are these things?\n",
      "They're goblins, Harry. Clever as they come goblins but not the most friendly of beasts. Bes' stay close. [Harry sticks to him. Hagrid clears his throat as they approach a counter with a goblin, wearing spectacles and a waistcoat, in it.] Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal.\n",
      "And does Mr. Harry Potter have his key?\n",
      "Oh, wait a minute. Got it here somewhere. Ha! There's the little devil. [Whispers] Oh, and there's something else as well. [Takes out a letter wrapped in a string.] Professor Dumbledore gave me this. [Hagrid hands the Goblin the letter.] It's about You-Know-What in vault You-Know-Which.\n",
      "Very well.\n",
      "Vault 687. Lamp, please. [Hagrid hands him the lamp and he walks to the vault] Key, please.\n",
      "Didn't think yer mum and dad will leave you with nothing now, did yeh?\n",
      "Vault 713.\n",
      "What's in there, Hagrid?\n",
      "Can't tell yeh, Harry. It's Hogwarts business. Very secret.\n",
      "Stand back. [Slides finger down the door. The vault opens to reveal a small white stone package. Hagrid enters the vault and scoops it up. The eerie light it was shining with disappears.]\n",
      "Bes' not to mention this to anyone, Harry.\n",
      "I still need... a wand.\n",
      "A wand? Well, yeh'll want Ollivanders. [he points to the store] There ain't no place better. Why don't you run along there and wait. I just got one more thing I got to do. Won't be long.\n",
      "[Softly] Hello? Hello?\n",
      "I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter. It seems only yesterday that your mother and father were in here buying their first wands. [Picks a wand] Ah. Here we are. [Harry holds it, but does nothing] Well, give it a wave. [Harry is hesitant, but waves. This causes most of the boxes to come flying out and crashing down. Harry jumps and hurriedly puts the wand back on the counter.] Apparently not. [Ollivander gets another wand from a box.] Perhaps this. [Harry waves at a vase, which shatters, startling Harry.] No, no, definitely not! No matter. [gets a wand from a box but stops and becomes thoughtful] I wonder... [Ollivander hands the wand to Harry. No sooner after he touched it, Harry suddenly glows under it, blowing his hair up and several of the paperwork in the background. Ollivander looked a bit surprised and deep in thought.] Curious. Very curious.\n",
      "Sorry, but what's curious?\n",
      "[examining the wand he gave to Harry] I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It just so happens that the phoenix, whose tail feather resides in your wand gave another feather, just one other. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar. [Points to the lighting bolt scar on Harry's forehead]\n",
      "And who owned that wand?\n",
      "We do not speak his name. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why. But I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things. Terrible, yes, but great. [he hands Harry back his wand.]\n",
      "Harry! Harry! Happy birthday! [Has a snowy owl in a cage, which hoots, his name is Hedwig.]\n",
      "[amazed] Wow.\n",
      "You all right, Harry? You seem very quiet.\n",
      "He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this. You know, Hagrid. I know you do.\n",
      "[sighs and pushes his bowl away] First, and understand this, Harry, 'cause it's very important. Not all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. A few years ago, there was one wizard who went as bad as you can go. And his name was V-...his name was V-...\n",
      "Maybe if you wrote it down?\n",
      "No, I can't spell it. All right. [quietly] Voldemort.\n",
      "Voldemort?\n",
      "Shh!!\n",
      "It was dark times, Harry, dark times. [We flash over to a flashback on the night at Godric's hollow, consisting off a cloaked man walking towards a house, breaking in with his wand, and proceeding to terrorize. Hagrid narrates.] Voldemort started to gather some followers, brought 'em over to the dark side. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Your parents fought against him, but nobody lived once he decided to kill 'em. [Harry's mother, Lily, screams in pain as she is killed by Voldemort's wand. Green flashes are seen from the windows outside the house. Then, we see Voldemort pointing his wand at an infant Harry Potter's head.] Nobody, not one. ‘Cept you.\n",
      "Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?\n",
      "Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry. A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse, and an evil curse at that.\n",
      "What happened to V... to You-Know-Who?\n",
      "Well, some say he died. Codswallop in my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's out there still, too tired to carry on. But one thing's absolutely certain. Something about you stumped him that night. That's why yer famous. That's why everybody knows yer name. You're the boy who lived.\n",
      "What're you looking at? [He then checks watch] Blimey, is that the time? Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you. Dumbledore will be wanting his, uh... well, he'll be wanting to see me. Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes. Here's your ticket. [hands the train ticket] Stick to it, Harry, that's very important. Stick to your ticket.\n",
      "\"Platform 9¾?\" But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says Platform 9¾. There's no such thing, is there? [Harry looks up, but we now see that Hagrid has vanished and Harry all alone with his cart.]\n",
      "Sorry.\n",
      "Excuse me, excuse me.\n",
      "Right on your left, madam.\n",
      "Excuse me, sir. Can you tell me where I might find Platform 9¾?\n",
      "[incredulous] 9¾? Think you're being funny, do ya? [he walks off, muttering] \"9¾.\"\n",
      "It's the same year after year. Always packed with Muggles, of course.\n",
      "Muggles?\n",
      "Come on. Platform 9¾ this way! All right, Percy, you first.\n",
      "Fred, you next.\n",
      "He's not Fred, I am!\n",
      "Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother.\n",
      "Oh, I'm sorry, George.\n",
      "I'm only joking. I am Fred. [He runs through the wall and is followed by his twin brother. Harry shakes his head in disbelief.]\n",
      "Excuse me! C-could you tell me how to...?\n",
      "How to get on the platform? Yes, not to worry, dear. It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as well. [pan to a red haired boy, called Ron, who smiles] Now, all you've got to do is walk straight at the wall between platforms 9 and 10. Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous.\n",
      "Good luck.\n",
      "Excuse me, do you mind? Everywhere else is full.\n",
      "Not at all.\n",
      "[sits across from Harry] I'm Ron, by the way. Ron Weasley.\n",
      "I'm Harry. Harry Potter.\n",
      "So-so it's true! I mean, do you really have the... the...?\n",
      "The what?\n",
      "[whispers] The scar?\n",
      "Oh. [Harry lifts up his hair bangs to reveal the scar on his forehead]\n",
      "Wicked!\n",
      "Anything off the trolley, dears?\n",
      "[Holds up his mushed sandwiches] No, thanks. I'm all set. [smacks lips.]\n",
      "We'll take the lot! [pulls out coins]\n",
      "Whoa!\n",
      "Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans?\n",
      "They mean every flavour! There's chocolate and peppermint, and there's also spinach, liver and tripe. George sweared he got a bogey-flavoured one once!\n",
      "[picks up a blue and gold package] These aren't real frogs, are they?\n",
      "It's just a spell. Besides, it's the cards you want. Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard. I got about 500 meself. [Harry opens the package, and a chocolate frog jumps onto the window and climbs up.] Watch it! [The frog reaches the open gap in the window and jumps out.] Oh, that's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them to begin with.\n",
      "[seeing Dumbledore's image in the card] I've got Dumbledore!\n",
      "I got about six of him.\n",
      "Hey, he's gone!\n",
      "Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you? [Scabbers squeaks] This is Scabbers, by the way. Pathetic, isn't he?\n",
      "Just a little bit.\n",
      "Fred gave me a spell as to turn him yellow. Want to see?\n",
      "Yeah!\n",
      "[clears throat] Ahem. Sun-\n",
      "Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville's lost one.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then.\n",
      "[clears throat again] Sunshine, daises, butter mellow, turn this stupid fat rat yellow!\n",
      "Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? Of course, I've only tried a few simple ones myself, but they've all worked for me. For example... [Hermione goes over and sits across from Harry. He points her wand at his glasses and Harry tenses] Oculus Reparo. [The tape on the noseband vanishes, repairing his glasses as if they were good as new. Harry takes them off, amazed.] That's better, isn't it? Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter! I'm Hermione Granger. And you are...?\n",
      "[with his mouth full] I'm Ron Weasley.\n",
      "Pleasure. You two better change into your robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon. [Gets up and leaves, then comes back and looks at Ron.] You've got dirt on your nose, by the way. Did you know? Just there. [Points to the dirt mark on Ron's nose. Ron scratches his nose, embarrassed.]\n",
      "Right, then! First years! This way, please! Come on, now, don't be shy! Come on now, hurry up!\n",

      "Welcome to Hogwarts. Now, in a few moments, you will pass through these doors and join your classmates. But before you can take your seats, you must be sorted into your houses. They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Now while you're here, your house will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you points. Any rule breaking, and you will lose points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup.\n",
      "Trevor! [he catches his toad; McGonagall stares down at him as some of the students laugh] Sorry. [He backs away, embarrassed.]\n",
      "The sorting ceremony will begin momentarily. [she leaves to go into the Great Hall]\n",
      "It's true then, what they're saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts. [some of the students are heard whispering, \"Harry Potter?\" Draco introduces his two friends.] This is Crabbe and Goyle. And I'm Malfoy. Draco Malfoy. [Ron snickers at his name] Think my name's funny, do you? I've no need to ask yours. Red hair, and a hand-me-down robe? You must be a Weasley. You'll soon find that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there. [extends his hand to Harry.]\n",
      "[not going to take Draco's arrogance] I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks.\n",
      "We're ready for you now. Follow me.\n",
      "It's not real, the ceiling. It's just bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts\n",
      "All right, will you wait along here, please? Now, before we begin, Professor Dumbledore would like to say a few words.\n",
      "I have a few start-of-term notices I wish to announce. The first years, please note that the Dark Forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch, [shows a ragged old man, called Mr. Argus Filch, with his cat with red eyes, called Mrs. Norris.] has asked me to remind you that the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. Thank you. [He sits back down]\n",
      "When I call your name, you will come forth. I shall place the sorting hat on your head, and you will be sorted into your houses. Hermione Granger.\n",
      "[to herself] Oh, no. Okay, relax. [She goes up]\n",
      "Mental, that one, I'm telling you.\n",
      "Ah, right then... hmm... right. Okay. Gryffindor!\n",
      "Draco Malfoy.\n",
      "Slytherin!\n",
      "There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin.\n",
      "Susan Bones.\n",
      "Ahh! [puts his hand on his forehead in pain]\n",
      "[concerned] Harry, what is it?\n",
      "Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine.\n",
      "Let's see... I know! Hufflepuff!\n",
      "Ronald Weasley.\n",
      "Ha! Another Weasley. I know just what to do with you. Gryffindor!\n",
      "Harry Potter.\n",
      "Hmm... difficult, very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind, either. There's talent, oh, yes. And a thirst to prove yourself. But where to put you?\n",
      "[whispering to the hat] Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!\n",
      "Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure? You could be great, you know. It's all here, in your head. And Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness! There's no doubt about that. No?\n",
      "Well, if you're sure. Better be... GRYFFINDOR!\n",
      "We got Potter! We got Potter!\n",
      "Your attention, please.\n",
      "[rising from his chair] Let the feast... begin.\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "I'm half and half. Me dad's a Muggle. Mam's a witch. Bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out.\n",
      "Say, Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?\n",
      "Oh, that's Professor Snape, head of Slytherin house.\n",
      "What's he teach?\n",
      "Potions. But everyone knows it's the Dark Arts he fancies. He's been after Quirrell’s job for years.\n",
      "Ahh!\n",
      "Hello! How are you? Welcome to Gryffindor.\n",
      "Whoo-hoo-hoo!\n",
      "Look, it's the Bloody Baron!\n",
      "Hello, Sir Nicholas. Have a nice summer?\n",
      "Dismal. Once again, my request to join the headless hunt has been denied. [Begins to leave]\n",
      "I know you! You're Nearly Headless Nick!\n",
      "I prefer Sir Nicholas if you don't mind.\n",
      "\"Nearly\" headless? How can you be nearly headless?\n",
      "Like this. [Grabs head and pulls it to the side. His head is hanging on just by a thread.]\n",
      "Ahh!\n",
      "Gryffindors, follow me, please. Keep up. Thank you.\n",
      "Ravenclaws, follow me. This way.\n",
      "This is the most direct path to the dormitories. Oh, and keep an eye on the staircases. They like to change.\n",
      "Keep up, please, and follow me. Quickly now, come on. Come on.\n",
      "Seamus, that picture's moving!\n",
      "Look at that one, Harry!\n",
      "I think she fancies you.\n",
      "Oh, look! Look! Who's that girl?\n",
      "Welcome to Hogwarts.\n",
      "Who's that?\n",
      "Password?\n",
      "Caput Draconis. [The Fat Lady smiles and nods in confirmation. The painting opens up to reveal a doorway in the wall, leading to Gryffindor Tower.] Follow me, everyone. Keep up. Quickly, come on.\n",
      "Oh, wow.\n",
      "[Inside the common room] Gather around here. Welcome to the Gryffindor Common Room. Boys' dormitory is upstairs and down to your left. Girls, the same on your right. You'll find that your belongings have already been brought up.\n",
      "Whew! Made it! Can you imagine the look on McGonagall's face if we were late?\n",
      "That was bloody brilliant!\n",
      "Thank you for that assessment, Mr. Weasley. Perhaps, it'd be more useful if I were to transfigure Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocketwatch. That way, one of you might be on time.\n",
      "We got lost.\n",
      "Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't need one to find your seats.\n",
      "There will be no foolish wand-waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion-making. However, for those select few... [looks at Draco, who smiles] ...who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory and even put a stopper... [Draco looks on] ...in death. [Draco raises his eyebrows. Snape sees Harry, writing what Snape said in his lecture down, in, his view, not paying attention.] Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confident enough... to not... pay... attention. [Hermione nudges Harry, finally making him look up to the Professor. Snape then walks to where he can speak to Harry more properly.] Mr. Potter. Our... new... celebrity. Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood? [Hermione raises her hand. Harry shrugs.] You don't know? Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar? [Hermione's hand raises again.]\n",
      "I don't know, sir.\n",
      "And what is the difference between monkshood and wolfbane?\n",
      "I don't know, sir.\n",
      "Pity. Clearly, fame isn't everything. [Draco has a smirk on his face] Is it, Mr. Potter?\n",
      "Clearly, Hermione knows. Seems a pity not to ask her.\n",
      "Silence. [he turns to Harry, looking a bit insulted; Harry seemingly gulps. Snape then walks over to his desk. To Hermione, who has still got her hand up.] Put your hand down, you silly girl. [He sits in front of Harry, and leans towards him.] For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. [everything is quiet] Well? [to the students] Why aren't you all copying this down? [The students obey Snape and start to write down what Snape said. Snape returns to his desk, and dips his quill into some ink.] And Gryffindors, note that five points will be taken from your house... for your classmate's cheek. [Snape then starts writing; Hermione looks at Harry and then starts writing. Harry looks at Snape, who turns slightly and then continues writing]\n",
      "Eye of rabbit, harp string hum. Turn this water, into rum. [Looks in cup and shakes head.] Eye of rabbit, harp string hum...\n",
      "What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?\n",
      "Turn it into rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday, before-\n",
      "Ah. Mail's here!\n",
      "Can I borrow this? [Ron nods] Thanks.\n",
      "Hey, look! Neville's got a Remembrall!\n",
      "I've read about those. When the smoke turns red, [the smoke turns red] it means you've forgotten something.\n",
      "The only problem is, I can't remember what I've forgotten.\n",
      "Hey, Ron! Somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen. [he reads the article] \"Believed to be the work of dark witches or wizards unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowledging the breach, insist that nothing was taken. The vault in question, number 713, had in fact been emptied earlier that same day.\" That's odd. That's the vault Hagrid and I went to.\n",
      "Good afternoon, class.\n",
      "Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.\n",
      "Good afternoon, Amanda, good afternoon. [to the class] Welcome to your first flying lesson. Well, what are you waiting for? Everyone step up to the left side of their broomstick. Come on now, hurry up. Stick your right hand over the broom and say, \"Up.\"\n",
      "Up!\n",
      "[amazed] Wow!\n",
      "Up! [broomstick flies up and Draco smugly grins.]\n",
      "Up. Up!\n",
      "With feeling!\n",
      "[as her broomstick slowly rises] Up. Up. Up. Up.\n",
      "Up!! [His broom immediately shot up and whacked him on the nose] Ooh! [Harry laughs] Shut up, Harry. [Ron then seemingly starts to laugh after he recovered]\n",
      "Now, once you've got hold of your broom, I want you to mount it. And grip it tight, you don't want to be sliding off the end. [the class mounts on their broomsticks] When I blow my whistle, I want each of you to kick off from the ground, hard. Keep your broom steady, hover for a moment, then lean forward slightly and touch back down. On my whistle. 3, 2...\n",
      "Oh...\n",
      "Mr. Longbottom.\n",
      "Neville, what are you doing?\n",
      "Neville... Neville...\n",
      "We're not supposed to take off, yet.\n",
      "[Neville begins soaring away uncontrollably] M-M-M-Mr. Longb-!\n",
      "AHH!\n",
      "Mr. Longbottom!\n",
      "Down! Down! Ahhhh!\n",
      "Neville!\n",
      "Help!!!\n",
      "Come back down this instant!\n",
      "AHH!\n",
      "Help!\n",
      "Mr. Longbottom-! [However, the students quickly stand back as Hooch dives out of the way, allowing Neville to fly right through. Neville goes through the scatter and up a tower.]\n",
      "Ahhhh! Whoa! Ahhh! [zooms past a statue of a man with a sharp spear. Neville's cloak catches on it. He is flipped off the broom and hangs there.] Oh. Ah... help! [He wavers, then the cloak rips through the spear, and he falls. But his cloak catches on a torch, making Neville slip off from his cloak a second later and fell to the ground.] Ow!\n",
      "Everyone out of the way! [She runs through the group, and they scatter.] Come on, get up.\n",
      "Is he alright?\n",
      "Ow, ow, ow, ow.\n",
      "Oh, oh, oh, oh dear. It's a broken wrist. Tch, tch, tch. Poor boy. Come on now, up you get. [Draco reaches down and grabs Neville's Remembrall, which has fallen from him. Hooch begins to lead Neville away with her.] Everyone's to keep their feet firmly on the ground while I take Mr. Longbottom to the hospital wing. Understand? If I see a single broom in the air, the one riding it will find themselves out of Hogwarts before they can say, Quidditch. [Madam Hooch leaves the field to take Neville to the hospital wing.]\n",
      "[snickers] Did you see his face? Maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze, he'd have remembered to fall on his fat arse. [He and his goons laugh; Harry approaches him.]\n",
      "Give it here, Malfoy.\n",
      "No. I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find. [he hops on his broom and soars around group, then through.] How about on the roof? [soars off and hovers several feet above the grounds.] What's the matter, Potter? Bit beyond your reach?\n",
      "Harry, no way! You heard what Madam Hooch said. Besides, you don't even know how to fly. [Harry flies off to face Draco, ignoring her.] What an idiot.\n",
      "Give it here, Malfoy, or I'll knock you off your broom!\n",
      "Is that so? [Harry makes a dash for him, but Draco twirls around his broom in a 360.] Have it your way, then.\n",
      "Nice going, Harry!\n",
      "Oh, that was wicked, Harry!\n",
      "Harry Potter! [Harry notices her] Follow me. [Harry sullenly follows her. Draco and his goons snicker in delight.]\n",
      "An iguana s-such as this is...\n",
      "You wait here.\n",
      "...an essential in-gredient.\n",
      "Professor Quirrell, excuse me, excuse me. Could I borrow Wood for a moment, please?\n",
      "Oh, y-yes, of course. [A boy called Oliver Wood, gets up to leave and Quirrell continues.] And the vampire b-bat... [as Wood exits the classroom, an eerie roar is heard.]\n",
      "Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood, I have found you a Seeker!\n",
      "Have you heard? Harry Potter's the new Gryffindor Seeker. I always knew he'd do well.\n",
      "Seeker? But first years never make their house teams! You must be the youngest Quidditch player in...\n",
      "A century, according to McGonagall.\n",
      "Hey, well done, Harry, Wood's just told us!\n",
      "Fred and George are on the team, too. Beaters.\n",
      "Our job is to make sure that you don't get bloodied up too bad. Can't make any promises, of course. Rough game, Quidditch.\n",
      "Brutal. But no one's died in years. Someone will vanish occasionally. [They break off from Harry and Ron, who walk across a courtyard.]\n",
      "But they'll turn up in a month or two!\n",
      "Oh, go on, Harry. Quidditch is great. Best game there is! And you'll be great, too!\n",
      "But I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself?\n",
      "You won't make a fool of yourself. It's in your blood.\n",
      "Whoa. Harry, you never told me your father was a Seeker, too.\n",
      "I didn't know.\n",
      "I'm telling you, it's spooky. She knows more about you than you do.\n",
      "Who doesn't?\n",
      "Ahh!\n",
      "What's happening?\n",
      "The staircases change, remember? [The staircase stops, leading to a corridor.]\n",
      "[taps Ron] Let's go this way.\n",
      "Before the staircase moves again.\n",
      "Does anyone feel like we shouldn't be here?\n",
      "We're not supposed to be here. This is the 3rd floor. It's forbidden.\n",
      "Let's go.\n",
      "It's Filch's cat!\n",
      "Run!\n",
      "Quick! Let's hide through that door!\n",
      "It's locked!\n",
      "That's it! We're done for!\n",
      "Oh, move over! [pushes through and pulls out her wand, aiming it at the lock] Alohomora. [The door's lock lifts up magically and it opens.] Get in. [They bustle in.]\n",
      "Alohomora?\n",
      "Standard Book of Spells, Chapter 7.\n",
      "Anyone here, my sweet? [Mrs. Norris meows] Come on. [they leave the corridor.]\n",
      "Filch is gone.\n",
      "Probably thinks this door's locked.\n",
      "It was locked.\n",
      "And for good reason. [Ron and Hermione turn to stand with Harry. There is a massively huge three headed dog sleeping in front of them. The dog begins to wake. It growls, yawns, and growls more...noticing the intruders.]\n",
      "AHHHHHHH! [The three bolt, running out of the door. They turn quickly to shut the door and battle against the dog. They get the door shut and run.]\n",
      "What do they think they're doing? Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school.\n",
      "You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?\n",
      "I wasn't looking at its feet! I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice. There were three! [they begin to climb the stairs to the dorms.]\n",
      "It was standing on a trapdoor. Which means it wasn't there by accident. It's guarding something.\n",
      "Guarding something?\n",
      "That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed. Or worse, expelled. [turns and leaves, shutting the door to her dormitory.]\n",
      "She needs to sort out her priorities.\n",
      "Quidditch is easy enough to understand. Each time has seven players. Three Chasers, two Beaters, one Keeper and a Seeker. That's you. There are three kinds of balls. [picks up a red one] This one's called the Quaffle. Now, the chasers handle the Quaffle and try to put it through one of those three hoops. [Points to the hoops in the Quidditch pitch in the distance.] The keeper, that's me, defends the hoops. [throws ball to Harry.] With me so far?\n",
      "[throws back] I think so. What are those? [points to two squirming chained down balls.]\n",
      "You better take this. [hands Harry a small bat. He bends down and releases one ball. With an angry growl, it flies off into the air. The two boys watch it.] Careful now, it's coming back. [The balls comes whizzing down, and Harry cracks at it with the bat. The ball soars off through a statue, surprisingly without damaging it.] Not bad, Potter. You'd make a fair Beater. Uh-oh. [The ball zooms down, and Oliver grabs it, wriggling to get it back in the box. He succeeds and is out of breath.]\n",
      "What was that?!\n",
      "Bludger. Nasty little buggers. But you are a Seeker. And the only thing I want you to worry about is this. The Golden Snitch. [hands Harry a walnut sized golden ball.]\n",
      "I like this ball.\n",
      "Ah, you like it now. Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see.\n",
      "What do I do with it?\n",
      "You catch it. Before the other team's Seeker. You catch this, the game is over. You catch this, Potter, and we win.\n",
      "Whoa!\n",
      "One of a wizard's most rudimentary skills is levitation, or the ability to make objects fly. Uh, do you have your feathers? [Hermione raises hers.] Good. Now, uh, don't forget the nice wrist movement we've been practising. Hmm? The swish and flick. Everyone.\n",
      "The swish and flick.\n",
      "Good. Oh, and enunciate. Wingardium Leviosa. Off you go, then.\n",
      "Wingardium Levio-saaa.\n",
      "Wingardium Leviosa.\n",
      "Wingardrium Leviosar! [He waves his wand really fast numerous times because he thinks the spell didn't work. Hermione stops him.]\n",
      "No, stop, stop, stop! You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, you're saying it wrong. It's Levi-o-sa, not Leviosar.\n",
      "You do it, then, if you're so clever. Go on, go on.\n",
      "Wingardium Leviosa. [The feather glows and lifts up.]\n",
      "Oh, well done! See here, everyone, Miss Granger's done it! Oh, splendid!\n",
      "Wingard Leviosa. Wingar-\n",
      "Well done, dear.\n",
      "Whooaaa! Ooh.\n",
      "I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor.\n",
      "[mimicking Hermione] \"It's Levioooosa, not Leviosaaaar.\" [normal voice] She's a nightmare, honestly! No wonder she hasn't got any friends!\n",
      "I think she heard you.\n",
      "Where's Hermione?\n",
      "Parvati Patil said that she wouldn't come out of the girl's bathroom. She said that she'd been in there all afternoon, crying.\n",
      "TROLL! IN THE DUNGEON! T-TROOLLL IN THE DUNGEON! [Dumbledore rises from his seat in concern. Everyone looks at Quirrell and he stops and there is utter silence.] Thought you ought to know.\n",
      "SILLLLLEEENNNNCEEEEE! [Everyone stops and calms down.] Everyone will please not panic! Now, prefects will lead their house back to the dormitories. Teachers will follow me to the dungeons.\n",
      "Hufflepuff, this way!\n",
      "Stay together!\n",
      "Gryffindors, keep up, please, and stay alert!\n",
      "How could a troll get in?\n",
      "Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid. Probably people playing jokes. [Suddenly, Harry stops and pulls Ron aside.] What?\n",
      "Hermione! She doesn't know!\n",
      "I think the troll's left the dungeon!\n",
      "It's going into the girl's bathroom!\n",
      "Hermione, move!\n",
      "Help! Help! [The boys start throwing wood pieces at the troll.]\n",
      "Hey, pea brain! [Ron throws wood and hits the troll on the head. Hermione escapes from the stalls to under a sink, but the troll sees her and then comes over to smash her. It cracks the sink and barely misses Hermione. Harry cringes.]\n",
      "(screams) Help!\n",
      "Whoa! [He lands on the troll's shoulders and is hurled around back and forth.]\n",
      "Ew!\n",
      "Whoa, whoa-whoa!\n",
      "Do something!\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Anything! [the troll swipes at Harry again] Hurry up!\n",
      "Swish and flick!\n",
      "[correctly punctuating the words] Wingardium Leviosa! [Flick! The troll's club is lifted out of one of his hands and hovers above its head. The troll looks at his hand and opens it, then looks up, confused, just as the club comes crashing back down.] Cool. [It hits the troll's head that hard and the troll wavers, then drops Harry, who crawls away, and slowly comes crashing down, knocked out. Hermione approaches carefully.]\n",
      "Is it dead?\n",
      "I don't think so. Just knocked out. [He grabs his wand which is covered in mucus.] Ugh! Troll bogies.\n",
      "Oh! Oh, my goodness! Explain yourselves, both of you!\n",
      "Well, what it is...\n",
      "It's my fault, Professor McGonagall. [The teachers, Ron and Harry look at her.]\n",
      "Miss Granger?\n",
      "I went looking for the troll. I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me, I'd probably be dead.\n",
      "Be that as it may, it was an extremely foolish thing to do. [Harry notices Snape's leg, which has the trousers' leg torn and a large cut on it. Snape notices and covers it up, glaring at Harry.] I would've expected more rational behavior on your part and am very disappointed in you, Miss Granger. Five points will be taken from Gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment. [she turns to Harry and Ron] As for you two gentlemen, I just hope you realize how fortunate you are. Not many first-year students could take on a fully grown mountain troll and live to tell the tale. Five points will be awarded to each of you... [Harry and Ron grin at each other] ...for sheer dumb luck.\n",
      "Perhaps you ought to go. It m-might wake up. Heh. [Harry, Ron and Hermione exit the bathroom. Quirrell looks at the unconscious troll. The troll growls, seemingly going to wake up.] Ahh! Hehe....\n",
      "[to Hermione] Good for you to get us out of trouble like that.\n",
      "Mind you, I mean, we did save her life.\n",
      "Mind you, she didn't need saving if you hadn't insulted her.\n",
      "What are friends for?\n",
      "Take a bit of toast, mate, go on.\n",
      "Ron's right, Harry. You're gonna need your strength today.\n",
      "I'm not hungry.\n",
      "Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you. Even if it is against Slytherin. [Snape walks off, limping. Harry notices this.]\n",
      "That explains the blood.\n",
      "Blood?\n",
      "Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. But, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping.\n",
      "But why would anyone go near that dog?\n",
      "The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. He said it was Hogwarts' business, very secret.\n",
      "So you're saying...\n",
      "That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants.\n",
      "Bit early for mail, isn't it?\n",
      "But I... I never get mail.\n",
      "Let's open it.\n",
      "It's a broomstick!\n",
      "Thats not just any broomstick, Harry. [recognizing the model] It's a Nimbus 2000!\n",
      "But who...?\n",
      "Scared, Harry?\n",
      "A little.\n",
      "That's all right. I felt the same way before my first game.\n",
      "What happened?\n",
      "Er, I don't really remember. I took a Bludger to the head two minutes in. Woke up in the hospital a week later.\n",
      "Hello! And welcome to Hogwarts' first Quidditch game of the season! Today's game, Slytherin vs. Gryffindor!\n",
      "Gryffindor!\n",
      "The players take their positions as Madam Hooch steps out onto the field to begin the game!\n",
      "Now, I want a nice, clean game from all of you! [looks at Slytherin. She kicks the trunk, and the Bludgers zoom out.]\n",
      "The Bludgers are up, followed by the Golden Snitch. Remember, the Snitch is worth 150 points. The Seeker who catches the Snitch ends the game.\n",
      "The Quaffle is released and the game begins!\n",
      "Angelina Johnson scores! 10 points for Gryffindor! [He presses a button and a 10 shows up beside a plaque with Gryffindor's name.]\n",
      "Yes! [A Bludger suddenly zooms by him.] Whoa!\n",
      "Well done!\n",
      "Slytherin takes possession of the Quaffle. Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.\n",
      "Yay!\n",
      "Yes!\n",
      "Another 10 points to Gryffindor! [he adds another 10 to the score with a ding.]\n",
      "Yay!\n",
      "Give me that! [he grabs a beaters bat from one and whacks a Bludger right at Oliver. It hits Oliver directly in the stomach and he plummets to the ground, knocked out.]\n",
      "[to his teammates] Take that side!\n",
      "Whoa! Whooa!\n",
      "What's going on with Harry's broomstick?\n",
      "It's Snape! He's jinxing the broom!\n",
      "Jinxing the broom? What do we do?\n",
      "Leave it to me. [She hands Ron her binoculars and leaves the stands.]\n",
      "[concerned] Come on, Hermione!\n",
      "[quietly] Lacarnum Inflamarae.\n",
      "Fire! You're on fire!\n",
      "What? Oh! [knocks the man back, who falls into Quirrell, who then also falls. Snape bats out the fire and acts as though nothing happened. The broom stops bucking, and Harry climbs back on. The Slytherin seeker is after the Snitch. Harry takes off.]\n",
      "Go!\n",
      "Go, go, go!\n",
      "Looks like he's gonna be sick!\n",
      "He's got the Snitch! Harry Potter receives 150 points for catching the Snitch!\n",
      "[Blows her whistle whilst riding on her broomstick] Gryffindor wins!\n",
      "[dismayed] No!\n",
      "Yes!\n",
      "Whoo-hoo!\n",
      "Go, go, Gryffindor! Go, go, Gryffindor! Go, go, Gryffindor! Go, go, Gryffindor!\n",
      "Nonsense! Why would Snape put a curse on Harry's broom?\n",
      "Who knows? Why was he trying to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween?\n",
      "[turns to them, suspiciously] Who told you about Fluffy?\n",
      "Fluffy?\n",
      "That thing has a name?\n",
      "Well, of course he's got a name. He's mine. I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. Then I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the...\n",
      "Yes?\n",
      "Shouldn't have said that. No more questions! Don't ask any more questions. That's top secret, that is.\n",
      "But, Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it.\n",
      "Codswallop. Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher.\n",
      "Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a spell when I see one. I've read all about them. You've got to keep eye contact and Snape wasn't blinking.\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "[Sighs] Now, you listen to me, all three of yeh. Yer meddling in things that ought not to be meddled in. It's dangerous. What that dog is guarding is strictly between Professor Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.\n",
      "[Curious and turns to Ron then back to Hagrid] Nicholas Flamel?\n",
      "[Mumbles to himself] I shouldn't have said that. I should not have said that.\n",
      "Nicholas Flamel. [Turns to Hermione] Who's Nicholas Flamel?\n",
      "I don't know. [Shakes her head]\n",
      "Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Ring the Hogwart bell. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas...\n",
      "Knight to E5. [The Knight moves to its destination. Hermione walks up behind Harry.]\n",
      "[With a smug face] Queen to E5.\n",
      "[With a shocked face] That's totally barbaric!\n",
      "That's wizard's chess. [Looks over to Hermione] I see you've packed.\n",
      "I see you haven't.\n",
      "Change of plans, my parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother, Charlie. He's studying dragons there.\n",
      "Good. You can help Harry, then. He's going to go and look in the library for information on Nicholas Flamel.\n",
      "We've looked a hundred times!\n",
      "[Leans over on the table closer to Ron and Harry] Not in the restricted section. Happy Christmas. [Hermione leaves Ron and Harry]\n",
      "[Looks at Harry] I think we've had a bad influence on her.\n",
      "[From downstairs] Harry, wake up! Come on, Harry, wake up!\n",
      "[Looking up at Harry] Happy Christmas, Harry.\n",
      "Happy Christmas, Ron. [Harry notices Ron's sweater] What are you wearing?\n",
      "[Looks down at sweater] Oh. My mum made it. [Looking back up at Harry] It looks like you've got one too.\n",
      "I-I've got presents?\n",
      "[Nodding] Yeah!\n",
      "There they are.\n",
      "\"Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well.\" [Harry looks over to Ron, who shrugs his shoulders]\n",
      "What is it?\n",
      "[Looking down at the object] It's some kind of cloak.\n",
      "Well, let's see, then. Put it on.\n",
      "Whoa!\n",
      "[Looks down at his invisible body] My body's gone!\n",
      "I know what that is. That's an invisibility cloak!\n",
      "I'm invisible? [Harry spins around, looking down at himself]\n",
      "They're really rare. [Ron looks down at the note] I wonder who gave it to you.\n",
      "[Now also looking down at the note] There was no name. It just said, \"Use it well.\"\n",
      "Famous fire eaters. 15th-Century Fiends. Flamel. Nicholas Flamel. Where are you?\n",
      "Who's there?! [Harry whips around and quickly grabs his cloak, causing the lamp to fall and shatter.] I know you're in there. You can't hide. [Harry puts on his cloak and creeps around Filch.] Who is it? Show yourself!\n",
      "Severus... I-I thought...\n",
      "You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell.\n",
      "I don't know w-what you m-mean.\n",
      "You know perfectly well what I mean. [Snape senses something who causes Harry to stop breathing. Snape reaches out to grab something but doesn't. He whips his finger back in front of Quirrell's face.] We'll have another chat soon. When you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie.\n",
      "Oh, Professors. I found this in the Restricted Section. It's still hot. That means there's a student out of bed.\n",
      "Mum? [Lily nods and smiles] Dad? [James nods and smiles. Harry reaches out to touch them but only gets the mirror. Then, his mother puts her hand on his shoulder. He puts his own hand on his own shoulders, as if trying to feel her there.]\n",
      "Ron, you've really got to see this! Ron, you've got to see this! [pulls back covers. Ron wakes up.] Ron, Ron, come on, get out of bed!\n",
      "[tired] Why?\n",
      "There's something you've got to see. Now, come on!\n",
      "Come on! Come! Come look, it's my parents!\n",
      "I only see us.\n",
      "[moves over] Look in properly. Go on, stand there. There. You see them, don't you? That's my dad.\n",
      "That's me! Only I'm head boy. And I'm holding the Quidditch cup. And bloody hell! I'm Quidditch Captain too! I look good. Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?\n",
      "How can it? Both my parents are dead. [Harry smiles sadly.]\n",
      "Do you like yours, Ron? [Ron turns to Harry who still sits in front of the fireplace who is very quiet.] Ron?\n",
      "I'll be right back. [He leaves the table and comes up to Harry.] Want to play chess?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Wanna go and visit Hagrid?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Harry, I know what you're thinking, but don't. There's something not right about that mirror.\n",
      "Back again, Harry? [Harry turns around and stands up.] I see that you, like so many before you have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I trust by now you realize what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is.\n",
      "So then, it shows us what we want. Whatever we want.\n",
      "[whilst looking at the mirror] Yes. And no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, Harry, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it. Even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home. And I must ask you not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live. [Harry looks back at the mirror, knowing that Dumbledore is right.]\n",
      "Hi, Hedwig. [Hedwig has just flown down to the table where Harry, Ron and Hermoine are studying]\n",
      "Look at you, playing with your cards. Pathetic! We've got final exams coming up soon.\n",
      "I'm ready. Ask me any question.\n",
      "Alright, what are the three most crucial ingredients in a Forgetfulness Potion?\n",
      "I forgot.\n",
      "And what, may I ask, do you plan to do if this comes up in the final exam?\n",
      "Copy off you?\n",
      "No, you won't. Besides, according to Professor McGonagall, we're to be given special quills bewitched with an anti-cheating spell.\n",
      "That's insulting! It's as if they don't trust us! [checks a card, irritated] Dumbledore again!\n",
      "Leg-Locker Curse?\n",
      "Malfoy. [Neville approaches them amidst laughter from the other students]\n",
      "You have got to start standing up to people, Neville.\n",
      "[wobbling uncontrollably] How? I can barely stand at all!\n",
      "[jumping up, wand at the ready] I'll do the countercurse!\n",
      "No, that's all I need! You to set my bloody kneecaps on fire!\n",
      "[slamming his wand down angrily] I don't appreciate the insinuation, Longbottom. Besides, if anyone cares to notice, my eyebrows have completely grown back! [He then stalks off angrily, showing a large chunk of hair missing from the back of his head.]\n",
      "I found him! [hands Ron a Chocolate Frog card of Dumbledore]\n",
      "\"Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark\" Wizard Grindelwald in 1945–\"\n",
      "Go on.\n",
      "\"-for his discovery of the 12 uses of Dragon Blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner Nicolas Flamel!\"\n",
      "I knew the name sounded familiar. I read it on the train that day.\n",
      "[beaming excitedly] Follow me!\n",
      "Hey! Wait! Where are you going? What about the countercurse? [Before he can say another word, he topples over backwards and then falls to the ground. The other students start laughing.]\n",
      "I had you looking in the wrong section. How could I be so stupid? I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading.\n",
      "This is light?\n",
      "Of course! Here it is! [as she reads the description in the page] Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone.\n",
      "The what?\n",
      "Honestly, don't you two read? \"The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It'll transform any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life which will make the drinker immortal.\"\n",
      "Immortal?\n",
      "It means you'll never die.\n",
      "I know what it means!\n",
      "Shh!\n",
      "\"The only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist who last year celebrated his 665th birthday.\" That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor. That's what's under the trapdoor. The Philosopher's Stone.\n",
      "Hagrid!\n",
      "Oh, hello, sorry, don't wish to be rude, but I'm in no fit state to entertain today.\n",
      "We know about the Philosopher's Stone!\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "We think Snape's trying to steal it.\n",
      "Snape? Blimey, yer not still on about him, are yeh?\n",
      "Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. We just don't know why.\n",
      "Snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone. He's not about to steal it.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "You heard. Right. Come on, now, I'm a bit preoccupied today.\n",
      "Wait a minute. [Ron soon sees Hagrid's boar-hound Fang, who sniffs him.] \"One of the teachers?\"\n",
      "[whilst sitting in a large chair] Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments.\n",
      "That's right. Waste of bloody time, if yeh ask me. [Hermione looks at Ron, who is still being sniffed in the face by Fang. Finally Ron shuffles away.] Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy. Hehe. Ain't a soul knows how, except for me and Dumbledore. I shouldn't have told you that. I should not have told you that. [A cauldron over a fire begins to rattle.] Oh! [Hagrid hurries over and grabs something] Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! [He places it on the table. It was an egg. The group crowds around.]\n",
      "Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that?\n",
      "That? It's a... it's, um...\n",
      "I know what that is! But, Hagrid, how did you get one?\n",
      "I won it. Off a stranger I met down at a pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid of it, as a matter of fact.\n",
      "Is that... a dragon?\n",
      "That's not just a dragon. That's a Norwegian Ridgeback. My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.\n",
      "Isn't he beautiful? Oh, bless him. Look, he knows his mummy. Hehehe. Hallo, Norbert.\n",
      "Norbert?\n",
      "Yeah, well, he's gotta have a name, don't he? [Ron laughs] Don't you, Norbert? [he raises fingers back and forth across Norbert's chin] Dededede.\n",
      "Ohh! [he quickly pats out the smolders in his beard] Oooh, ooh, ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo! Ooh, well... he'll have to be trained up a bit, of course. Heh. [Norbert hiccups. Hagrid sees someone looking in the window.] Who's that? [It turns out to be Draco Malfoy, who scampers away.]\n",
      "Malfoy.\n",
      "Oh, dear.\n",
      "Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I ever met him.\n",
      "It's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows.\n",
      "I don't understand. Is that bad?\n",
      "It's bad.\n",
      "Good evening.\n",
      "[sternly] Nothing, I repeat, nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night. Therefore, as punishment for your actions, 50 points will be taken.\n",
      "50?!\n",
      "Each. [Harry gasps] And to ensure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention.\n",
      "Excuse me, Professor, perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said the four of us.\n",
      "No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy. You see, honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours. You will join your classmates in detention.\n",
      "A pity they let the old punishments die. There was a time detention would find you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons. God, I miss the screaming. [Draco gulps, and Hermione rushes by.] You'll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight. He's got a little job to do inside the Dark Forest. [Hagrid appears with a crossbow. He sniffles.] A sorry lot, this, Hagrid. Oh, good God, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?\n",
      "[sniffs and sighs] Norbert's gone. Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony.\n",
      "Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind.\n",
      "Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania? [Filch rolls eyes.] What if the other dragons are mean to him? He's only a baby, after all.\n",
      "Oh, for God's sake, pull yourself together, man. You're going into the Forest, after all. Got to have your wits about you.\n",
      "The Forest? I thought that was a joke! We can't go in there. Students aren't allowed. And there are... [a howl sounds] ...werewolves!\n",
      "There's more than werewolves in those trees, lad. You can be sure of that. [Draco looks frightened.] Nighty-night. [He leaves to go back into the castle]\n",
      "Right. Let's go.\n",
      "Hagrid, what is that?\n",
      "What we're here for. See that? That's unicorn's blood, that is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one's been hurt bad by something. [Harry suddenly sees a large, cloaked figure walking through the trees. He looks at Hagrid.] So, it's our job to go and find the poor beast. Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy. [Draco grimaces, and Harry nods.]\n",
      "Okay. Then I get Fang.\n",
      "Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward. [Fang whines.]\n",
      "You wait till my father hears about this. This is servant's stuff.\n",
      "If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared.\n",
      "Scared, Potter? [He scoffs, but suddenly hears a howl] Did you hear that? Come on, Fang. Scared!\n",
      "What is it, Fang?\n",
      "HELP!!!!!\n",
      "Harry Potter, you must leave. You are known to many creatures here. The Forest is not safe at this time. Especially for you.\n",
      "But what was that thing you saved me from?\n",
      "A monstrous creature. It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. But at a terrible price. You have slain something so pure that from the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. A cursed life.\n",
      "But who would choose such a life?\n",
      "Can you think of no one?\n",
      "Do you mean to say that thing that killed the unicorn that was drinking its blood, that was Voldemort?\n",
      "Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment, Mr. Potter?\n",
      "[realizing] The Philosopher's Stone.\n",
      "Harry!\n",
      "Hello there, Firenze. I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. You all right there, Harry? [Harry nods]\n",
      "Harry Potter, this is where I leave you. You're safe now. Good luck.\n",
      "[she, Harry, and Ron are meeting in the common room] You mean You-Know-Who's out there right now in the Forest?\n",
      "But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong. Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself. He wants the Stone for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He'll... he'll come back.\n",
      "But if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to kill you, do you?\n",
      "I think if he'd had the chance, he might have tried to kill me tonight.\n",
      "[gulps] And to think, I've been worrying about my Potions final.\n",
      "Hang on a minute. [Harry and Ron both glance at her] We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared? Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore is around, Harry, you're safe. As long as Dumbledore is around, you can't be touched. [gives him a reassuring smile; he nods]\n",
      "I'd always heard Hogwarts' end-of-the-year exams were frightful, but I've found that rather enjoyable.\n",
      "Speak for yourself. All right there, Harry?\n",
      "My scar. It keeps burning.\n",
      "It's happened before.\n",
      "Not like this.\n",
      "Perhaps you should see the nurse.\n",
      "I think it's a warning. It means danger's coming. [A look of realization] Ah. Oh! Of course!\n",
      "What is it?\n",
      "Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have one? I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pocket? Why didn't I see it before?\n",
      "Hagrid, [Hagrid stops playing] who gave you the dragon egg? What did he look like?\n",
      "I dunno. I never saw his face. He kept his hood up.\n",
      "This stranger, though, you and he must have talked.\n",
      "Well, he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. I told 'im. I said, \"After Fluffy, a dragon's gonna be no problem.\"\n",
      "Did he seem interested in Fluffy?\n",
      "Well, o' course he was interested in Fluffy. How often do yeh come across a three-headed dog, even if yer in the trade? But I told 'im. I said... I said, \"The trick with any beast is to know how to calm 'im. Take Fluffy, for example. Jus' play him a bit o' music and he falls straight to sleep.\" I shouldn't have told you that. [The Trio runs off] Where're you goin'? Wait?\n",
      "We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!\n",
      "I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here. He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London.\n",
      "He’s gone? Now? But this is important! This is about the Philosopher's Stone!\n",
      "[Looking shocked] How do you know...?\n",
      "Someone's going to try to steal it!\n",
      "I don't know how you three found out about the Stone, but I assure you it is perfectly well protected. Now would you go back to your dormitories? Quietly.\n",
      "That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape. Which means he knows how to get past Fluffy.\n",
      "And with Dumbledore gone...\n",
      "Good afternoon. Now, what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this?\n",
      "Uh, w-w-w... we-we were just-\n",
      "You ought to be careful. People will think you're... up to something. [Walks away]\n",
      "Now what do we do?\n",
      "[With a determined look] We go down the trapdoor. Tonight.\n",
      "Trevor.\n",
      "Trevor, shh, go! You shouldn't be here!\n",
      "[appears behind a chair] Neither should you. You're sneaking out again, aren't you?\n",
      "Now, Neville, listen. We were-\n",
      "No! I won't let you! [stands] You'll get Gryffindor into trouble again! I-I'll fight you. [Neville holds out his fists.]\n",
      "Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this.[takes out wand] Petrificus Totalus.\n",
      "[Gulp] You're a little scary sometimes, you know that? Brilliant, but scary.\n",
      "Let's go. [Walks by Neville] Sorry.\n",
      "Sorry.\n",
      "It's for your own good, you know.\n",
      "Ow! You stood on my foot!\n",
      "Sorry. [A flame lights up. Hermione draws out her wand and points it at the door.]\n",
      "Alohomora.\n",
      "Wait a minute. He's....\n",
      "Snoring.\n",
      "Snape's already been here. He's put a spell on the harp.\n",
      "Ugh! It's got horrible breath.\n",
      "We have to move its paw.\n",
      "What?!\n",
      "Come on! [grabs paw, which is blocking the door.] Okay. Push! [They strain and move it. They open the door.] I'll go first. Don't follow until I give you a sign. [Fluffy's eyes open.] If something bad happens, get yourselves out. Does it seem a bit quiet to you?\n",
      "The harp. It stopped playing.\n",
      "Ew! Yuck! Ugh. [All three kids look up and see Fluffy standing there. Fluffy barks and growls, thrashing. It breaks the harp and dives at the three.]\n",
      "Jump! Go! [They all jump through the trapdoor.]\n",
      "Ahh! [gasps as he lands on some mushy black ropelike vines.] Whoa. Lucky this plant-thing's here, really.\n",
      "Whoa! [The plant begins to move towards them.] Oh. Ahh! [The plant ties both of them up like a rope.]\n",
      "Stop moving, both of you. This is Devil's Snare. You have to relax. If you don't, it will only kill you faster.\n",
      "Kill us faster?! Oh, now I can relax!\n",
      "Hermione!\n",
      "Now what are we gonna do?!\n",
      "Just relax!\n",
      "Hermione, where are you?\n",
      "[from below] Do what I say! Trust me.\n",
      "Ahh! Harry!\n",
      "Harry!\n",
      "Are you okay?\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.\n",
      "Help!\n",
      "He's not relaxing, is he?\n",
      "Apparently not.\n",
      "Help! Help me!\n",
      "We've gotta do something!\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Uh! I remember reading something in Herbology.\n",
      "Help!\n",
      "Um, Devil's Snare, Devil's Scare, [The snare shuts Ron's mouth] it's deadly fun... but will sulk in the sun! That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight! [takes out wand and points upwards.] Lumus Solem! [A beam of light shoots out. The Snare shrieks and recoils. Ron falls below.]\n",
      "Ahhh!\n",
      "Ron, are you okay?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "[stands] Whew! Lucky we didn't panic.\n",
      "Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.\n",
      "What is that?\n",
      "I don't know. Sounds like wings.\n",
      "Curious. I've never seen birds like these.\n",
      "They're not birds. They're keys. And I'll bet one of them fits that door. [They come upon a broomstick, suspended in the air.]\n",
      "What's this all about?\n",
      "I don't know. Strange.\n",
      "[rattles lock.] Alohomora! [Shrugs] Well, it was worth a try.\n",
      "Ugh! What're we going to do? There must be a thousand keys up there!\n",
      "We're looking for a big old fashioned one. Probably rusty like the handle.\n",
      "There! I see it! [points] The one with the broken wing. [He looks at the broom.]\n",
      "What's wrong, Harry?\n",
      "It's too simple.\n",
      "Oh, go on, Harry! If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can! You're the youngest Seeker in a century!\n",
      "This complicates things a bit.\n",
      "Catch the key!\n",
      "Hurry up!\n",
      "I don't like this. I don't like this at all.\n",
      "Where are we? A graveyard?\n",
      "This is no graveyard. [sighs] It's a chessboard. [Walks out onto the marble board and flames light, illuminating the board and GIANT players. Harry and Hermione come up with him.]\n",
      "There's the door.\n",
      "Now what do we do?\n",
      "It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room. Alright. Harry, you take the empty Bishop's square. Hermione, you'll be the Queen-side castle. As for me, I'll be a knight. [They all take their places.]\n",
      "What happens now?\n",
      "[aboard a horse.] Well, white moves first. And then... we play. [A pawn on the other side moves forward. Ron studies the game.]\n",
      "Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like... real wizard's chess, do you?\n",
      "You there, D5. [A black pawn moves forward, diagonal to the white pawn. The white pawn raises its swords and smashes the black one. The three jump.] Yes, Hermione. I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess.\n",
      "Castle to E4! [Smash!]\n",
      "Pawn to C3! [Smash! Boom! The Queen turns and smashes a piece! Harry, Ron, and Hermione wince.]\n",
      "Wait a minute.\n",
      "You understand right, Harry. Once I make my move, the Queen will take me. Then you're free to check the King.\n",
      "No. Ron, no!\n",
      "What is it?\n",
      "He's going to sacrifice himself!\n",
      "No, Ron, you can't! [Ron closes his eyes.] There must be another way!\n",
      "[turns to face Hermione.] Do you want to stop Snape from getting that Stone or not? Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it. Not me. Not Hermione. You! [Harry nods.] Knight to H3.\n",
      "Check.\n",
      "Ahhhh!\n",
      "RON! [Hermione starts walking to him.] No, don't move! Don't forget, we're still playing. [Hermione moves back. Harry walks the diagonal in front of the King.] Checkmate. [The King's sword falls onto the ground in victory. Harry breathes out and then the two run to Ron. They bend beside him.] Take care of Ron. Then go to the owlery. Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right. I have to go on.\n",
      "You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great wizard. You really are.\n",
      "Not as good as you.\n",
      "[smile] Me? Books and cleverness? There are more important things. Friendship, and bravery. And Harry, just be careful.\n",
      "You? [Quirrell turns to face him] No, i-it can't be. Snape, h-he was the one—\n",
      "Yes, he does seem the type, doesn't he? Next to him, who would suspect p-p-p-poor, st-stuttering Professor Quirrell?\n",
      "But-but that day, during the Quidditch match, Snape tried to kill me.\n",
      "[smiling evilly] No, dear boy. I tried to kill you! [Harry eyes him in disbelief and confusion] And trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would have succeeded. Even with Snape muttering his little countercurse.\n",
      "Snape was trying to save me?\n",
      "I knew you were a danger to me right from the off. Especially after Halloween.\n",
      "Then-then you let the troll in!\n",
      "Very good, Potter, yes. Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled. While everyone else was running about the dungeon, he went to the third floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again. [he turns towards the mirror again; Harry winces as his scar burns again] He rarely left me alone. But he doesn't understand. I'm never alone. Never. [staring into the mirror] Now, what does this mirror do? I see what I desire. I see myself holding the Stone. But how do I get it?\n",
      "Use the boy. [Harry looks around, wondering where the voice is coming from]\n",
      "[turns to Harry] Come here, Potter! Now! [Harry slowly walks down the stairs, towards Quirrell and the mirror] Tell me, what do you see? [Harry looks into the mirror, and for a few seconds, sees him standing next to Quirrell, then his reflection reaches into its pocket and pulls out a gleaming red ruby, the Philosopher’s Stone; Harry stares in amazement as his reflection smiles and winks, then puts the stone back in its pocket; Harry feels his pocket and realizes the Stone really is in his pocket, then looks up again] What is it? [glances at Harry while speaking] What do you see?\n",
      "[looks at Quirrell, then back at the mirror, determined not to let Quirrell know that he has the Stone] I-I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore. I've won the House Cup.\n",
      "He lies.\n",
      "[angrily shouting] Tell the truth! What do you see?\n",
      "Let me speak to him.\n",
      "[as Harry backs away] Master, you are not strong enough.\n",
      "I have strength enough for this.\n",
      "Harry Potter, we meet again.\n",
      "[realizing his identity] Voldemort.\n",
      "Yes. You see what I've become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another. A mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can. Something that, conveniently enough, lies in your pocket. [Realizing Voldemort is referring to the Philosopher's Stone, Harry turns and runs back up the stairs.]\n",
      "Stop him! [Quirrell snaps his fingers, instantly causing fire walls to block all the exits, trapping Harry in the room] Don't be a fool. Why suffer a horrific death when you can join me and live?\n",
      "[shakes his head] Never!\n",
      "Haha. Bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry, would you like to see your mother and father again? Together, we can bring them back. [In the mirror, Harry's parents appear in the reflection.] All I ask for is something in return. [Harry takes the Stone from his pocket.] That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil. There is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do extraordinary things. Just give me the Stone! [James and Lily Potter fade from the reflection]\n",
      "You liar!\n",
      "Kill him!\n",
      "Ahh! Ahh! [He backs up away from Harry. His hand is crumbling into ash and dust.] What is this magic? [His hand disintegrates]\n",
      "Fool, get the Stone!\n",
      "Good afternoon, Harry. Ah. Tokens from your admirers?\n",
      "Admirers?\n",
      "What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret. So, naturally, the whole school knows. [They both smile.] Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs.\n",
      "Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione?\n",
      "Fine. They're both just fine.\n",
      "But what happened to the Stone?\n",
      "Relax, dear boy. The Stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around.\n",
      "But then, Flamel, he'll die, won't he?\n",
      "[sits on the bed.] He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die.\n",
      "How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next...\n",
      "Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me that is saying something.\n",
      "Does that mean, with the Stone gone, that is, that Voldemort can never come back?\n",
      "Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him? [Harry shakes his head.] It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you. And that kind of act leaves a mark. [Harry touches his scar.] No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin.\n",
      "What is it?\n",
      "Love, Harry. Love. [Pats Harry's head gently and stands up.] Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit-flavoured one. And since then, I'm afraid I've lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee. [takes brown bean and eats it.] Mm. Alas! Earwax.\n",
      "All right there, Ron?\n",
      "All right. You?\n",
      "[as he shrugs] All right. Hermione?\n",
      "[smiling] Never better.\n",
      "Another year gone. And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarding. And the points stand thus\n",
      "Nice one, mate. [sneers at Ron]\n",
      "[giving Hermione a pat on the back] Good job. [Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle don't like what's happening. Hermione looks at Hagrid, who looks back to her with a proud smile.]\n",
      "Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess that Hogwarts has seen these many years, 50 points. [Ron looks even more surprised than Hermione did and the Gryffindor table is applauding even louder.] And third, to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house 60 points.\n",
      "We're tied with Slytherin!\n",
      "And finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award 10 points to Neville Longbottom. [Neville can't believe what he just heard and the Gryffindors that heard Hermione's whisper are cheering the loudest. Malfoy looks quite uncertain now.] Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of decoration is in order. [He claps and motions his hands towards the Slytherin banners, where they flap heavily, until the banners have changed completely to red and gold with the Gryffindor symbol] Gryffindor wins the House Cup.\n",
      "Come on, now. Hurry up, you'll be late. Train's leaving. Go on. Go on. Come on, hurry up.\n",
      "Come on, Harry.\n",
      "One minute. [He walks over to Hagrid]\n",
      "Thought you were leaving without saying goodbye, didja? [Hagrid takes a red album out of his coat pocket and hands it to Harry.] This is fer you.\n",
      "Thanks, Hagrid. [Shakes Hagrid's hand, then hugs him tightly.]\n",
      "Oh. Go on. On with you. On with you now. [Harry lets go] Oh, listen, Harry. If that dolt of a cousin of yours, Dudley, gives you any grief, you could always, um, threaten him with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail of his.\n",
      "But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that.\n",
      "I do. But your cousin don't, do he? Eh? [chuckle] Off you go.\n",
      "Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?\n",
      "I'm not going home. Not really.\n"
