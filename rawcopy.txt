\"Mrs. Weasley: Cover your faces and take a spbreedsray, It’s Doxycide. I’ve never seen an infestation this bad — what that house-elf’s been doing for the last ten years —\",
\"Hermione: Kreacher’s really old, he probably couldn’t manage —\",
\"Sirius: Anyway . . . I’ve just been feeding Buckbeak, I keep him upstairs in my mother’s bedroom. Anyway . . . this writing desk . . . Well, Molly, I’m pretty sure this is a boggart, but perhaps we ought to let Mad-Eye have a shifty at it before we let it out — knowing my mother it could be something much worse.\",
\"Mrs. Weasley: Right you are, Sirius,\",
\"Sirius: “I keep telling them not to ring the doorbell!”\",
\"Mrs. Black: Stains of dishonor, filthy half-breeds, blood traitors, children of filth . . .\",
\"Mrs. Weasley: Close the door, please, Harry,\",
\"Kingsley: Hestia’s just relieved me, so she’s got Moody’s cloak now, thought I’d leave a report for Dumbledore . . .\",
\"Mrs. Weasley: Right, you lot, you need to be careful, because doxies bite and their teeth are poisonous. I’ve got a bottle of antidote here, but I’d rather nobody needed it. When I say the word, start spraying immediately, They’ll come flying out at us, I expect, but it says on the sprays one good squirt will paralyze them. When they’re immobilized, just throw them in this bucket. “All right — squirt!” Fred, what are you doing? Spray that at once and throw it away!\",
\"Fred: Right-o,\",
\"George: We want to experiment with doxy venom for our Skiving Snackboxes,\",
\"Harry: What are Skiving Snackboxes?\",
\"George: Range of sweets to make you ill, Not seriously ill, mind, just ill enough to get you out of a class when you feel like it. Fred and I have been developing them this summer. They’re double-ended, color-coded chews. If you eat the orange half of the Puking Pastilles, you throw up. Moment you’ve been rushed out of the lesson for the hospital wing, you swallow the purple half — ‘— which restores you to full fitness, enabling you to pursue the leisure activity of your own choice during an hour that would otherwise have been devoted to unprofitable boredom. ’ That’s what we’re putting in the adverts, anyway, But they still need a bit of work. At the moment our testers are having a bit of trouble stopping puking long enough to swallow the purple end.\",
\"Harry: Testers?\",
\"Fred: Us, We take it in turns. George did the Fainting Fancies — we both tried the Nosebleed Nougat —\",
\"George: Mum thought we’d been dueling,\",
\"Harry: Joke shop still on, then?\",
\"Fred: Well, we haven’t had a chance to get premises yet, so we’re running it as a mail-order service at the moment. We put advertisements in the Daily Prophet last week.\",
\"George: All thanks to you, mate, But don’t worry . . . Mum hasn’t got a clue. She won’t read the Daily Prophet anymore, ’cause of it telling lies about you and Dumbledore.\",
\"Mrs. Weasley: I think we’ll tackle those after lunch.\"
